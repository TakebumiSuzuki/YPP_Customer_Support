We know it can be a stressful and difficult situation when your channel is hacked. Fortunately, there are steps that you can take to recover your channel.\n\nBefore taking action, it\u2019s important to double check for signs that your channel may have been hacked.\n\nEvery YouTube channel is associated with at least one Google Account. When a YouTube channel is hacked, it means that at least one of the Google Accounts associated with the channel is also compromised.\n\nIf you notice any of the following, your Google Account may have been hacked, hijacked, or compromised:\n\n  * **Changes you didn\u2019t make:** Your profile picture, descriptions, email settings, AdSense for YouTube association, or sent messages are different.\n  * **Uploaded videos that aren't yours:** Someone has posted videos as your Google Account.

These reasons include harmful content (malware) and deceptive emails disguised as a type of service that you\u2019re familiar with (phishing). To keep your account safe, never share your email address and password information with others. Never download files or software from a source you don\u2019t trust.\n\nTo recover a hacked YouTube channel, it\u2019s necessary to first recover the hacked Google Account associated with the YouTube channel.\n\nThere are 3 steps to recover your YouTube channel:\n\n| 1\\.

Don\u2019t share passwords or sign-in info with anyone else.

When the upload flow is complete, your video will be available to stream in low quality, on a wide variety of devices.\n\nHigher qualities, such as 4K or 1080p, can take more time to process. While this processing happens, your video may seem to be missing higher qualities for several hours. Once high-resolution processing is finished, higher qualities will be available on your video.\n\n[LINK] https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71674\n\n[CATEGORY] Fix upload problems\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Low video quality after upload\n\n## About processing time\n\nProcessing time depends on many factors, like:\n\n  * Video format\n  * Video length\n  * Frame rate\n  * Quality\n\nHigher quality videos, like videos in 4K or 1080p, take longer to both upload and process. The same is true for videos with higher frame rates, such as 60-fps.\n\nFor instance, 4K videos are 4 times larger than 1080p videos. It can take 4 times longer for 4K quality to be available after an upload finishes. A 4K video with a frame rate of 30 fps that is 60 minutes long can take up to 4 hours to finish high-resolution processing. A 4K video with a frame rate of 60fps will take longer.\n\n[LINK] https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71674\n\n[CATEGORY] Fix upload problems\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Video stuck during upload\n\nTips for videos taking a long time to upload or that are stuck during upload.\n\nUploading times vary depending on your file size. The uploading time can also vary due to internet bandwidth and upload traffic. Uploading can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. If your upload seems stuck, or is taking a long time, it may be due to:\n\n  * **File type and size** : Your video\u2019s file type and video format changes its size. To make your uploads faster, encode your videos in one of these recommended formats.\n  * **Slow internet connection** : Search \u201cInternet speed test\u201d on Google to check your internet connection. Slow or unstable internet connection is one of the main causes of slow uploads.\n  * **Heavy uploads traffic** : You might be uploading during a busy time. At some peak hours, your internet service provider registers spikes of upload traffic and might take longer to upload your video to YouTube. Find out more about video performance on YouTube.\n  * **Quality** : Higher quality videos take longer to upload. For instance, a 4K video will take longer to upload than a 1080p video.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing any of these issues, we recommend that you let your video finish uploading to YouTube.\n\n#### Continue a previous upload\n\nIf you had to quit your upload for any reason, you have up to 24 hours to continue uploading where you left off. Return to youtube.com/upload and select the same file from your computer to continue.\n\n[LINK] https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/4525858\n\n[CATEGORY] Fix upload problems\n\n\n"

If your content violates our Community Guidelines, your channel will get a strike. \n\n**Note** : We may remove content for reasons other than Community Guidelines violations.

        "content": "# Community Guidelines strike basics on YouTube\n\n## What happens when you get a strike\n\nWhen you get a strike, you're told via email. You can also choose to have notifications sent to you through your mobile and computer notifications, and in your channel settings. We\u2019ll also tell you:\n\n  * What content was removed\n  * Which policies it violated (for example harassment or violence)\n  * How it affects your channel\n  * What you can do next\n\nIf your content violates our Community Guidelines, here\u2019s how it affects your channel:\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe understand mistakes happen and you don\u2019t mean to violate our policies \u2014 that\u2019s why the first violation is typically only a warning. To have this warning expire after 90 days, you can take a policy training. However, if your content violates the same policy within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike.\n\nSometimes a single case of severe abuse will result in channel termination without warning. If you think we made a mistake, you can appeal the warning.\n\n#### Optional policy trainings\n\nPolicy trainings are short in-product educational experiences based on the specific Community Guidelines policy you\u2019ve violated. \n\nIf you receive a Community Guidelines warning, you can access the policy training from your Studio account anywhere you typically check your policy violations. This includes the Studio dashboard and the Content tab. You\u2019ll also see a link to open the training from the email and banner notifications. Note: Not all Community Guidelines warnings are eligible for policy trainings. \n\nIf you complete an optional policy training, your warning will expire after 90 days. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.\n\nRepeated violations of our policies\u2013 or a single case of severe abuse\u2013 may still result in the termination of your account. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking trainings in the future.\n\n#### First Strike\n\nIf we find your content doesn\u2019t follow our policies for a second time, you'll get a strike.\n\nThis strike means you will not be allowed to do the following for 1 week:\n\n  * Upload videos or live streams\n  * Start a scheduled live stream\n  * Schedule a video to become public\n  * Create a Premiere\n  * Add a trailer to an upcoming Premiere or live stream\n  * Create custom thumbnails or Community posts\n  * Create, edit, or add collaborators to playlists\n  * Add or remove playlists from the watch page using the \u201cSave\u201d button\n\nYour scheduled public content is set to \u201cprivate\u201d for the penalty period duration. You have to reschedule it when the freeze period ends.\n\n**Note:** Penalty starts from the date of acknowledgement.\n\nAfter the 1-week period, we restore full privileges automatically, but the strike remains on your channel for 90 days.\n\nA strike may also result in losing access to advanced features. Learn more about how to regain access.\n\n#### Second Strike\n\nIf you get a second strike within the same 90-day period as your first strike, you will not be allowed to post content for 2 weeks. If there are no further issues, after the 2-week period, we restore full privileges automatically. Each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued.\n\n#### Third Strike\n\n3 strikes in the same 90-day period results in your channel being permanently removed from YouTube. Each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued.\n\n**Note:** Deleting your content doesn't remove a strike. We may also issue a Community Guidelines strike on deleted content. You can learn more about when we retain deleted content in our Privacy policy.\n\nIf your Official Artist Channel gets a Community Guidelines strike, the channel will be suspended and become a standard channel.

        "content": "# Trending on YouTube\n\nTrending helps viewers see what\u2019s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos and Shorts that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video.\n\nTrending isn't personalized and displays the same list of trending videos to all viewers in the same country, which is why you may see videos and Shorts in Trending that aren\u2019t in the same language as your browser. However, in India, Trending displays a list of results for each of the 9 most common Indic languages.\n\nIn certain countries, popular Shorts may be highlighted on a shelf or a tab within the trending page or you may see the Shorts listed as Trending in your feed or on the pivot pages. \n\nThe list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739\n\n[CATEGORY] Find videos on YouTube\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Trending on YouTube\n\n## What determines if a video is ranked on Trending?\n\nAmongst the many great new videos on YouTube on any given day, Trending can only show a limited number. Trending aims to surface videos that:\n\n  * Are appealing to a wide range of viewers\n  * Are not misleading, clickbaity or sensational\n  * Capture the breadth of what\u2019s happening on YouTube and in the world\n  * Showcase a diversity of creators\n  * Ideally, are surprising or novel\n\nTrending aims to balance all of these considerations. To achieve this, Trending considers many signals, including (but not limited to):\n\n  * View count\n  * How quickly the video is generating views (i.e. \u201ctemperature\u201d)\n  * Where views are coming from, including outside of YouTube\n  * The age of the video\n  * How the video performs compared to other recent uploads from the same channel\n\nWe combine these signals to produce a list of videos that showcases what\u2019s happening on YouTube, while being relevant to our viewers and reflective of the content on the platform. This means that the video with the highest view count on a given day may not be #1 on Trending, and videos with more views may be shown below videos with fewer views.  \n\nWe're very careful about the safety of what appears on Trending, so we have filters to make sure we don\u2019t show videos that contain excessive profanity, mature content, or violence, or videos that are otherwise inappropriate, such as disparaging others in the community. In the US and other locales, we have staff involved as a final filter to ensure safety and appropriateness.  \n\nYouTube doesn't accept payment for placement on Trending and doesn't favor specific creators. We don't include views from YouTube ads in selecting videos for Trending. In most major markets, we make sure that at least half the videos on trending come from creators who are primarily creating content for YouTube.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739\n\n[CATEGORY] Find videos on YouTube\n\n\n"

These channels are titled \u201cArtist Name - Topic\u201d and say \u201cauto-generated by YouTube\u201d in the channel\u2019s About section. Learn about auto-generated topic channels for artists below.\n  * An Official Artist Channel , a collection of an artist\u2019s music and videos from across all their different YouTube channels. You can find an artist's Official Artist Channel (OAC) by searching for the artist on YouTube. You can also find their OAC by watching an artist's official music video. Learn about Official Artist Channels.\n\nIf you\u2019re already subscribed to an artist\u2019s topic channel or partner-provided channel, you\u2019ll automatically be subscribed to their Official Artist Channel when it\u2019s created. Notifications will then be sent from the artist's Official Artist Channel. Learn about notifications from artists below.\n\nOnce subscribed to an artist\u2019s Official Artist Channel, your subscriptions to their topic channel and partner-provided channel will be inactive. This means they\u2019ll no longer be in your subscriptions list. You can still find an artist's topic channel or partner-provided channel in Search, but these channels will no longer have a subscribe button.\n\nAs always, you can manage your subscriptions for any channel you subscribe to, including Official Artist Channels.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636475\n\n[CATEGORY] Find videos on YouTube\n\n\n"

This panel is meant to give you more info to help you better understand the sources of health content that you find and watch on YouTube.\n\nTo identify eligible health sources for this feature, we started in the US with a set of principles and definitions developed by a panel of experts convened by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) , and reviewed by the American Public Health Association (APHA). These foundational principles were published in a paper called _Identifying Credible Sources of Health Information in Social Media: Principles and Attributes_.\n\nAs we expand outside of the United States, we\u2019re referencing the work done by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2022, the WHO and NAM convened a meeting of global interdisciplinary experts to review and validate the principles developed for the US for global application. To expand these efforts globally, we may also reference work done by other agencies, such as in the UK.\n\nThe latest phase of our work allows us to  among individuals and non-accredited organizations. Principles for identifying credible sources were developed by a panel of experts convened in collaboration between the Council of Medical Specialty Societies (CMSS), NAM and the WHO.\n\nThe principles for authoritative health sources developed in the respective papers maintain that sources should be science-based, objective, transparent, and accountable. YouTube used these principles to identify types of health sources than can be considered authoritative:\n\n  * Organizations with pre-existing, standardized vetting mechanisms (including healthcare organizations, educational institutions, public health departments, and government organizations). Vetting mechanisms include accreditation, academic journal indexing, and government accountability rules. For more info, review figure 1 in the NAM paper.\n  * Individuals and non-accredited organizations with health-focused YouTube channels. Individuals and organizations have to apply and pass a series of eligibility checks to get an information panel. As part of that application process, we check that the individual, or an individual from the non-accredited organization who has oversight and review of the channel's content, is a licensed healthcare professional. Currently, this category of health source is eligible to surface in a limited number of countries.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9795167\n\n[CATEGORY] Get health info on YouTube\n\n\n"

This approach included the NHS 1) reviewing the principles developed by the expert panel convened by NAM for the UK context and 2) publishing a Standard for Creating Health Content, which outlines essential requirements and best practice guidance for organisations to follow, in order to create high quality health content.\n\nAs a starting point in the UK, only NHS organisations are being invited to self-certify against the NHS Standard for Creating Health Content. By completing the self-certification process, an NHS organisation channel will be eligible for information panels indicating NHS credibility.\n\nThis approach for the UK was reviewed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC).

Pay attention to upper-case or lower-case letters in the code.\n  * Make sure that you are using the coupon code for its intended purpose. For example, if you received a coupon code for a no cost movie or TV show rental, you cannot use the code to purchase another type of content.\n  * Verify that your coupon code is still valid: \n    * Check the expiration date: some coupon codes must be used before a set date. If you have a code that says 'only for a limited time', the expiry date will be indicated on the coupon code or in the email that you received.\n    * Check if the coupon code has already been used. Once a code has been used once, you cannot use the same code to get another no cost movie or TV program.\n  * Verify that you've selected a valid form of payment before clicking **Buy** to complete the discounted purchase or rental of your movie or TV show.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6193777\n\n[CATEGORY] Purchase movies & TV shows\n\n\n"

Our goal with multiview is to make it available to everyone with a television. Since most devices don\u2019t have native multiview capabilities, we\u2019ve chosen to do all of the processing of video feeds on our servers.

For example, you can tune in on your living room TV, while a family member watches on their tablet from a different room, and another member watches at the same time on their phone connected to your home Wi-Fi. There's no limit to the number of devices that you can use to sign in.\n\nOutside your home, you can watch on up to two separate streams.\n\n#### Set a home network\n\nIf you\u2019ve moved or you\u2019re having trouble with unlimited in-home streams, make sure you \u201cSet a Home Network\u201d using the YouTube TV app to enjoy unlimited streams.\n\n**Note:** YouTube TV is separate from the YouTube app. Look for \u201cYouTube TV\u201d on your smart TV or streaming device\u2019s app menu. Once you successfully set your home network using the YouTube TV app you can enjoy unlimited NFL Sunday Ticket streams on this network regardless of which app/website you use (YouTube or YouTube TV).\n\nYou can set up your home network on smart TVs only. To set your current Wi-Fi network as your YouTube TV home network, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n  1. Connect the smart TV to your home Wi-Fi.\n  2. Download and open the YouTube TV app on the smart TV.\n  3. Sign in to the YouTube TV app.\n  4. Select your profile photo **Settings** **Streaming limits**.\n  5. At the bottom, select **Set current network as home**.\n  6. Confirm that you are seeing the green tick that says \"Connected to Home Network.\"\n\n**Note:** If you have access via a family group, only the family manager can set the current network as home. Other family members can\u2019t see this option.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the \u201cSet Home Network\u201d, or \u201cConnected to Home Network\u201d option:\n\n  * Ensure you're using the right app (YouTube TV and not YouTube) and accessing that app on a smart TV, not a mobile device or computer.\n  * Check if you're logged into the right account that has an NFL Sunday Ticket membership.\n  * Check if you're outside your home location. You should just follow these steps if you're at home and connected to your preferred home Wi-Fi network.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the green tick, or see an error message that says \u201cCouldn't update. Try again\u201d, repeat the above steps.\n\nTo know more, Learn how to set your home network to watch without screen limits.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13821595\n\n[CATEGORY] NFL Sunday Ticket\n\n\n"

Check out these suggestions for how to cancel or to verify that you\u2019ve canceled your membership.\n\n#### What to do if you\u2019re having issues canceling\n\nIf the steps to cancel your membership are not working for you, here are some things you can try:\n\n  * Reload your web browser or restart your app and then try canceling again.\n  * Try a different browser or an incognito window on your computer.\n  * Log into your account on another device and try to cancel.\n\n#### How to verify that you canceled successfully\n\nHere are some ways you can confirm that you\u2019ve canceled your membership:\n\n  * **Search for a notification and email** : Immediately upon canceling your paid membership, you\u2019ll see a notification in the YouTube mobile app or on your computer confirming that you\u2019ve canceled your membership. Soon after canceling, you\u2019ll also get a cancellation confirmation email to the email address associated with your account. Search your inbox for emails ending in \u201c@youtube.com\u201d for confirmation of your cancellation. \n  * **Check the paid memberships hub** : Visit youtube.com/purchases to see if there\u2019s an end date listed for your membership and benefits. The date shown is the final day of your billing cycle and also when your benefits will end. If you do not see a date for when your benefits are set to end, please follow the steps to cancel and then check back.\n\n#### What to do if you see a charge after canceling\n\nYou may keep seeing charges after canceling for these reasons:\n\n  * **You may be seeing a charge for a different Google subscription or service** : Check the \u2018Activity\u2019 in your Google payments center to confirm the details on the charge and to verify if it is from a YouTube paid membership.\n  * **Your membership was mistakenly reactivated**. You or someone with access to your account may have accidentally renewed your membership at youtube.com/purchases. Visit that page to see if you have an active membership and follow the steps to cancel if you do.\n  * **You have more than one account with a YouTube paid membership**. You or someone with access to your account may have signed up using another email address, device, or billing platform. To check for other Google accounts: \n    1. Click your profile picture .\n    2. Click **Switch account**.\n    3. You should see a check mark next to the account that you're currently signed in with. If you see another account listed that also belongs to you, tap on it to switch to that account.\n    4. Check if your other account is signed up for a paid membership by visiting youtube.com/purchases. If there are no other accounts listed, you can always try signing in using other Google Accounts that belong to you and check for active memberships\n  * **You have more than one membership on your account**. Check out these common duplicate subscription scenarios to see if you may have mistakenly signed up for overlapping paid memberships.\n  * If you signed up through iPhone or iPad, you are billed for your YouTube paid membership through Apple. Apple has its own cancellation and billing policy which may differ from YouTube\u2019s. Contact Apple support for details of your membership and to verify cancellation.\n\n#### What happens after you cancel\n\n**You\u2019ll retain access to your benefits until the end of your billing cycle**. Regardless of when you cancel during your billing cycle, you\u2019ll have access to your paid membership benefits until the end of your ongoing billing cycle. You can view the details of your membership and the last day of your billing cycle by visiting youtube.com/paid_memberships.\n\n**Note** : Starting in 2022, new YouTube Premium and Music Premium subscribers who signed up on Android will be billed via Google Play. This change will not affect existing subscribers. You can visit payments.google.com to see recent charges and check how you are billed.

The most reliable way to properly record the metadata is to export from a supported app.\n\nIf you can't export standard HDR metadata, then you can use the YouTube HDR metadata tool to add HDR metadata to a video. This tool will only work correctly if your video was graded using an HDR transfer function.\n\n**Note:** If you aren't sure if your video was graded using an HDR transfer function, using this tool will badly distort your videos. Many videos with \"HDR\" in the title are not graded with an HDR transfer function. This tool will not work on those videos. Don't use the YouTube HDR metadata tool if you aren't familiar with color grading or didn't grade your own video in HDR.\n\nIf you're grading your video, grade in Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Using a different configuration, including DCI P3, will produce incorrect results.\n\nOnce a video has been properly marked as HDR, uploading it follows the usual process of uploading a video. YouTube will detect the HDR metadata and process it, producing HDR transcodes for HDR devices and an SDR downconversion for other devices.\n\n**Note:** HDR videos currently can't be edited with YouTube Web editor.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7126552\n\n[CATEGORY] Upload videos & stories\n\n\n"

However, on challenging clips, it might not deliver the perfect result. We're working on improving automated SDR downconversion so that it works great for all material. It's possible to give a hint to YouTube's SDR downconversion in the form of a 3D Look-Up Table, or LUT. To produce this LUT: \n\n  1. Load your HDR video into a color grading app without applying any color management.\n  2. Set your mastering display to Rec. 709 color and Gamma 2.4 transfer function.\n  3. Apply an existing LUT that converts from Rec. 2020 + ST. 2084 to Rec. 709, and then in subsequent nodes, change primary correctors, curves, and keys to get the look you want.\n  4. Export the LUT in the .cube format to the same folder as the HDR video.\n  5. Select both the LUT and the HDR video, and drag and drop them on the metadata tool.\n\nThe tool will apply metadata for the BVM-X300, and also pack in the LUT to give hints to the SDR downconversion.\n\n**Note:** Currently, there is no spatial or temporal control for hinting the SDR downconversion. Power windows and keys involving controls like Blur, won't work properly, nor will adjustments that apply to individual shots.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7126552\n\n[CATEGORY] Upload videos & stories\n\n\n"

Digital intermediate codecs like ProRes and DNxHR retain detail across the image range. Your videos may have noise in darker image regions that's visually masked by highlights in the image. YouTube's video processing may remove some noise to achieve streaming bitrates. You can get more control by denoising your video before rendering it for upload.

According to the FTC\u2019s guidance on COPPA, a video is child directed (which we call \u201cmade for kids\u201d) if: \n\n  * Children are the primary audience based on the factors described below. \n  * Children are not the primary audience, but the video is still directed to children based on the factors below. (This is known under COPPA as \u201cmixed audience\u201d content, which is a type of child directed content. General audience content is not the same as mixed audience.)\n\n**When deciding whether or not your channel or video is made for kids, you should consider various factors, including:**\n\n  * Subject matter of the video (e.g. educational content for preschoolers).\n  * Whether children are your intended audience (e.g. as indicated in your video metadata) or the actual audience for the video.\n  * Whether the video includes child actors or models.\n  * Whether the video includes characters, celebrities, or toys that appeal to children, including animated characters or cartoon figures.\n  * Whether the language of the video is intended for children to understand.\n  * Whether the video includes activities that appeal to children, such as play-acting, simple songs or games, or early education.\n  * Whether the video includes songs, stories, or poems for children.\n  * Any other information you may have to help determine your video\u2019s audience, like empirical evidence of the video\u2019s audience.\n  * Whether the content is advertised to children. \n\n**Notes:**\n\n  * Just because your content may include some of these factors does not automatically mean it\u2019s made for kids. You should carefully consider who you\u2019re trying to reach with your videos as you evaluate your content and the factors above.\n  * YouTube Analytics (YTA) is not designed to help determine if your content is child directed. You should use the factors outlined by the FTC above to set your audience.\n  * Videos that you set as \u201cmade for kids\u201d are more likely to be recommended alongside other kids\u2019 videos. Check out our most frequently asked questions about content that is made for kids. \n\n**Important** : As a creator, you know your videos and your audience best, and it is your legal responsibility to comply with COPPA and/or other applicable laws and designate your content accurately. Do not rely on our systems to set your audience for you because our systems may not identify content that the FTC or other authorities consider to be made for kids. If you fail to categorize your content correctly, there may be consequences on YouTube, as well as legal consequences under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or other applicable local laws. \n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076\n\n[CATEGORY] Upload \"made for kids\" videos\n\n\n"

Examples include content about sharing or being a good friend. Videos might also be about brushing your teeth or encouraging kids to eat vegetables.\n  * _**Learning and inspiring curiosity:**_ This content promotes critical thinking, discussing connected ideas, and exploring the world. Content should be age appropriate and designed for a young audience. It can also span traditional to non-traditional learning (for example, academics, informal learning, interest-based exploration, and tutorials).\n  * _**Creativity, play, and a sense of imagination:**_ This content is thought-provoking or imaginative. It may also encourage kids to create, make, and engage with something in a meaningful and novel way. Examples include creating imaginary worlds, storytelling, soccer tricks, sing-alongs, and creative activities like art and crafts.\n  * _**In**teraction** with real**-**world issues:**_ This content includes life lessons and strong characters, or encourages building social-emotional skills, problem solving, and independent thinking. It often includes a complete narrative (like character development, plot, resolution) and clear takeaway or lesson.\n  * _**Diversity, equity, and inclusion:**_ This content celebrates and encourages representation and participation of diverse perspectives and groups of people. It shows a range of ages, genders, races, religions, and sexual orientations. It also advocates for equal treatment of those differences.

This feature is currently only available to a limited set of creators in the United States and on certain mobile devices. The limited experiment is intended to ensure we are taking the proper steps to learn and build for any future iterations of the product.\n\nGlobal audiences can use the soundtracks as-is to remix them into their own Shorts.\n\nDream Track in Shorts is an experimental song creation tool that allows creators to create a unique 30-second soundtrack with the voices of opted-in artists. It brings together the expertise of Google DeepMind and YouTube\u2019s most innovative researchers with the expertise of our music industry partners, to open up new ways for creators on Shorts to create and engage with artists.\n\nOnce a soundtrack is published, anyone can use the AI-generated soundtrack as-is to remix it into their own Shorts. These AI-generated soundtracks will have a text label indicating that they were created with Dream Track. We\u2019re starting with a limited set of creators in the United States and opted-in artists. Based on the feedback from these experiments, we hope to expand this.\n\nYouTube\u2019s _Community Guidelines_ apply to all content on YouTube, including content generated by Dream Track, and we remain committed to removing any material that violates our policies.

When we get this type of feedback, we take it seriously. The Subscriptions team performs full investigations into the data submitted to see what's going on. In every case we\u2019ve looked at, we've verified that there's no issue causing viewers to be unsubscribed by YouTube. Here's what we've seen: \n\n  * Most of the time, we find that the viewer is still subscribed to the channel.\n  * Some viewers were unsubscribing from channels by accident. We've since added a confirmation pop-up when unsubscribing (this feature isn't currently available on iPhone and iPad devices).\n  * Many people thought they were unsubscribed from a channel because videos were not appearing in their Home tab. When we looked into these cases, we found they were still subscribed to the channel and had not been unsubscribed. The Home tab is designed to show you videos that we think you're most interested in watching. You\u2019re not guaranteed to see all videos from your subscriptions on the Home tab, but you can find a complete list in the Subscriptions feed.\n  * Some creators assumed that specific viewers had been unsubscribed because the subscriber didn't show up in their channel's Subscribers List. This list only shows subscribers who have chosen to make their subscriptions public. Subscriptions are private by default.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7280745\n\n[CATEGORY] Use YouTube Studio to manage your channel\n\n\n"

    {
        "content": "# Check your recent subscribers\n\n## Subscriber FAQs\n\n### Do all of my videos show up in my subscribers' Subscription feeds?\n\n  * Every video that you publish as a creator is shown in your subscribers' Subscriptions feeds by default. However, there\u2019s an advanced setting you can use when publishing a video to stop it showing in any Subscriptions feeds. Some creators who publish daily videos use this setting to strategically show only certain videos in the Subscriptions feed.\n  * When you upload a video, we publish it to the Subscriptions feed as fast as we can. Usually, it should take only a few minutes or less. Making this work as fast as possible is a huge priority for the Subscriptions team. In the last 6 months, we\u2019ve cut down publishing time by two-thirds.\n\n#### Why are my subscribers telling me my videos aren\u2019t showing up in their Subs feed?\n\nUnless you change your distribution options, we publish every video to the Subscriptions feed. When we hear complaints from viewers that they aren\u2019t seeing videos there, it's usually for one of two reasons:\n\n  * If you're subscribed to many channels, it\u2019s easy to miss something. Many viewers have dozens \u2014 even hundreds! \u2014 of subscriptions. Sometimes, the video you\u2019re looking for may be hard to find among lots of other subscription videos. If channels you're subscribed to post often, it's possible that older videos will not show in the Subscriptions feed.\n  * It's important to note that although all videos show in the Subscriptions feed, they don't all show in the Home tab. The Home tab shows videos that we think you as a viewer are most interested in watching right now. It isn\u2019t guaranteed that videos from your subscriptions will show up there.\n\nIf it seems like something else is happening, you can send us feedback and we'll look into it.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7280745\n\n[CATEGORY] Use YouTube Studio to manage your channel\n\n\n"

You can add alternative translations that will show up depending on the fan's language preferences.\n\n**Note:** Changing your channel name will also change your name across other Google products, unless you've transferred your channel to a Brand Account.

Even if a video is performing well compared with other videos on your channel, it may be that videos from other channels are performing even better. It\u2019s also common for videos with fewer impressions and views to have higher click-through-rates and average view duration. These higher numbers are because they've been viewed by a narrower, more loyal audience. While comparing video performance, keep in mind that the data may be more reflective of the differences in the audiences.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7628154\n\n[CATEGORY] Content tab (channel level)\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Impressions & click-through-rate FAQs\n\n### How do I know if my impressions click-through rate is high or low?\n\nImpressions click-through rate measures how often viewers watched a video after seeing a registered impression on YouTube. It likely represents a subset of your channel's total views, since not all impressions are counted in this metric, such those on external websites or end screens.\n\nImpressions click-through rate will vary based on the type of content, audience, and where on YouTube the impression was shown. Keep in mind that your video thumbnails are always competing against other videos, whether on the homepage, \u201cUp Next\u201d on the watch page, in search results, and even in subscription feeds.\n\nHalf of all channels and videos on YouTube have an impressions CTR that can range between 2% and 10%.\n\nNew videos or channels (like those less than a week old), or videos with fewer than 100 views can see an even wider range. If a video gets a lot of impressions (such as if it appears on the Home Page), it's natural for the CTR to be lower. Videos where most of the impressions are from sources like your channel page may have a higher rate.\n\nUltimately, it's best to compare CTRs between videos over the long-term and keep in mind how their traffic sources will affect their CTRs.\n\n**Avoid trying to increase your CTR using thumbnails or titles that areclickbait. **YouTube will recommend a video to viewers if the video is relevant to them and if the video's average view duration indicates that viewers find it interesting. Clickbait videos tend to have low average view duration and therefore are less likely to get recommended by YouTube. You can tell if your thumbnail is clickbait if it's getting high CTR but low average view duration and lower than expected Impressions. \n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7628154\n\n[CATEGORY] Content tab (channel level)\n\n\n"

CPM focuses on the advertiser cost for ad impressions. Playback-based CPM focuses on the advertiser cost for video playbacks that include one or more ads. Your playback-based CPM is often higher than your CPM. For example, say your video is viewed 5,000 times. 1,000 views included one ad and 500 other views included two ads, for a total of 1,500 views with ads. This instance means there were 2,000 individual ad impressions, but only 1,500 monetized playbacks. Let\u2019s say the advertiser paid $7 total. The video\u2019s cost per impression would equal the $7 advertiser cost divided by the 2,000 ad impressions, or, $0.0035. The CPM, or cost per 1000 impressions, would then equal $0.0035 times 1,000, or, **$3.50**. The playback-based CPM would equal $7 divided by the 1,500 monetized playbacks, times 1,000, or **$4.67**.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314357\n\n[CATEGORY] Revenue tab\n\n\n"

Your revenue will not be equal to your CPM times your views because CPM reflects what advertisers pay, not what you earn. Also, not all views will have ads.

For instance, many advertisers bid higher just before holidays.\n  * **Changes in viewer geography** : Advertisers can control which geographies they\u2019d like to reach with their ads. Different locations will have different levels of competition in the ad market, so CPMs will vary by geography. If there\u2019s a shift in where most of your views are coming from, you may see a shift in CPM. For instance, if you previously had views from a geography with higher CPMs, but are now getting more views from geographies with lower CPMs, you may see a decrease in your CPM.\n  * **Shifts in distribution of available ad formats** : Different ad types tend to have different CPMs. If, for instance, there are more available non-skippable ads in the ad inventory, CPM might be higher.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314357\n\n[CATEGORY] Revenue tab\n\n\n"

A standard moderator can:\n\n  * **Go to channel** : You can learn about a live chat participant before taking a moderation action by going directly to their channel.\n  * **Remove** : You can remove any inappropriate or potentially abusive or offensive content. When you delete a message, it\u2019s permanently removed from the live chat with any replies.\n  * **Hide user from this channel** : When you hide someone from the channel, their chat messages and comments will no longer be visible to other viewers. YouTube doesn't tell the person that you've hidden them.\n  * **Review potentially Inappropriate messages** : You can show or hide comments or messages that have been held for review based on your community settings.\n\nA managing moderator can do the above, in addition to:\n\n  * **Community default** : You can turn on this feature to use technology to automatically detect spam, self-promotion, gibberish, and other potentially inappropriate content in comments. Learn more.\n  * **Turn Live Chat on/off** : You can turn Live chat on or off at any time, even after the event has started.\n  * **Participation mode** : You can change participation modes in live chat by choosing subscriber only, members only, or live commentary.\n  * **Message delay** : You can limit how often each user can send a chat message by setting a time limit between messages.\n  * **Blocked words** : You can block live chat messages that contain or closely match certain words.\n  * **Manage standard moderators** : You can add and remove approved users.\n\n**Note:** Managing moderators don\u2019t have access to the Live Control Room or YouTube Studio.

Viewer notification settings cause almost all notification issues. Ask viewers to use the notifications troubleshooter if they aren\u2019t getting notifications.\n  2. **Notify subscribers when uploading videos**. When uploading a video, keep the box next to \u201cPublish to Subscriptions feed and notify subscribers\u201d on the \u201cAdvanced settings\u201d tab checked.\n  3. **Check how often you've posted in the last 24 hours**. Viewers can get a maximum of 3 new video notifications from each channel in a 24 hour period. Read more about notification limits below.\n  4. **Avoid publishing videos in bulk**. If you publish more than 3 videos in a short time period, we may temporarily stop sending notifications for 24 hours. Publishing videos in bulk can overwhelm subscribers and our notification systems. This hold happens even if all but 1 video is opted out of sending notifications. If you upload a few videos at a time, try uploading them as \u201cPrivate\u201d first. You can then publish each video at different times.\n  5. **Keep videos public after publishing**. It typically takes 10\u201320 minutes for all notifications to be sent. If you quickly change your video\u2019s privacy setting to \u201cPrivate\u201d after publishing, we\u2019ll stop sending notifications. \n  6. **Check if your subscriber count changed drastically just before publishing your video**. In these situations, we'll tell all eligible subscribers, but it may seem like less than 100% of subscribers were told due to reporting delays.\n  7. **Check for known issues**. In rare instances, there may be issues in delivering notifications. To learn if these issues are happening, check the Known Issues section of the Help Center or the TeamYouTube Twitter handle.\n  8. **Send feedback**. If you\u2019ve checked all of the above and subscribers still aren\u2019t getting notifications, send us feedback.\n\nSubscribe to the YouTube Viewers channel for the latest news, updates, and tips.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7389684\n\n[CATEGORY] Manage subscribers\n\n\n"

To help you achieve your goals, here are some examples of how to make the most of fundraising through YouTube.\n\n#### Some examples of what you can do:\n\n  * **Fundraise with YouTube Giving:**Eligible channels in certain locations can fundraise for available nonprofits by adding the Donate button to their videos and live streams. Learn how to set up a fundraiser here.\n  * **If you\u2019re not eligible for YouTube Giving:** Use End Screens to link to an external fundraiser**.** End screens can be added to the last 5\u201320 seconds of a video. There are several approved third party fundraising sites (like GoFundMe, JustGiving) that can be linked to in end screens.\n  * **Donate your own revenue from specific videos:** Make original content that your audience loves to watch. You can tell your viewers that you will donate the money you earn to a specific nonprofit. But, you should not encourage them to click or watch ads to increase the contribution.\n\n#### Some examples of what you can\u2019t do:\n\n  * Don\u2019t encourage spammy activity like repeated watching and clicking ads in your videos. As a reminder spammy activity is a violation of our Fake Engagement policy and our policies _,_ and your video may be removed. When we identify this behavior, creators will not be paid for these views and clicks, and advertisers will not be charged.\n  * Don\u2019t upload the work of other creators or artists without making sufficient changes. If you\u2019re going to use work you didn\u2019t create where you want to take donations, your video could be claimed under copyright protections.\n  * Don\u2019t make false claims about donating to the organization or nonprofit.

YouTube also reserves the right to restrict a creator's ability to live stream at its discretion.\n\nIf you receive a warning on your live stream for violating our Community Guidelines, you can take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future.\n\nIf your live stream is restricted, you may get a strike on your account. A strike will prevent you from live streaming for 14 days. If your account has been restricted from live streaming, you\u2019re prohibited from using another channel to live stream on YouTube.

        "content": "# Live streaming latency\n\n### Why is there a trade-off between latency and quality?\n\nThe lower the latency, the less read-ahead buffer the video player will have. The amount of read-ahead buffer is important because it's the main source of stream latency. With a lower latency, viewers are more likely to feel the issues between the encoder and the player. Network congestion and other factors may also cause live streaming issues, which can delay your stream. Delays can happen even when you have a great network that can sustain your average streaming bitrate. Generally, your viewers' player can handle these changes in internet speed by keeping some extra live stream data. This function is called Buffer Health in Stats for Nerds.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7444635\n\n[CATEGORY] Use an encoder to live stream\n\n\n"

The messages are displayed next to the _Health Indicator_ at the top of the Live Control Room.\n\nThere's a timestamp next to each error indicating when it was seen. If the error isn't fixed, it will continue to pop up. Errors in are _critical_ and may inhibit your event from starting or cause users to have problems. Errors in are _moderate_ and may cause degraded quality in your event.\n\nThe complete list of errors is below:\n\n#### Daily live stream limit achieved:\n\nTo help make YouTube safer for everyone, we limit how many live streams a channel can create in a 24 hour period. To increase your daily limit, see this article.\n\n#### Incorrect stream format\n\nYour encoder is set to something other than H.264 video and AAC audio. Change to H.264 video and AAC audio for the stream to be properly ingested.\n\n  * Please change the container format for the video. The current container format isn't right for this configuration.\n  * The audio stream is encoded with an unsupported codec. Please set the audio codec for the stream to a supported codec (AAC, MP3).\n  * Please set the video codec for the stream to H.264. The video is encoded with the wrong codec.\n  * Please correct the video codec profile for the stream. The video is encoded with the wrong codec profile.\n\n#### Incorrect bitrates\n\nIf you aren't using a variable resolution entrypoint, you must use the exact bitrate for the resolution you chose on the Ingestion Settings page. If you don't have enough bandwidth for the resolution you chose, consider lowering your chosen resolution. The correct bitrates for each resolution are listed in the encoder settings. Correct the error messages to make sure your video is transcoded and delivered properly.\n\n  * We recommend you use an audio stream bitrate value of 128Kbps. The current bitrate for the audio stream is higher than the recommended bitrate.\n  * We recommend you use an audio stream bitrate value of 128Kbps. The current bitrate for the audio stream is lower than the recommended bitrate.\n  * Please correct the sample rate for audio in the stream to 44.1KHz. The current sample rate is incorrect.\n  * We recommend you use a stream bitrate value of X. The current bitrate value for the stream is higher than the recommended bitrate.\n  * We recommend you use a stream bitrate value of X. The current bitrate value for the stream is lower than the recommended bitrate.\n\n#### Incorrect audio settings\n\nYour encoder is sending incorrect audio settings. Correct the error messages to make sure your audio is delivered properly.\n\n  * Please provide one audio stream. The ingestion stream contains no audio stream. \n    * Your encoder is sending no audio. On some encoders there's a checkbox to turn on audio. YouTube's pipeline requires audio on all videos.\n  * Please provide only one audio stream. The ingestion stream contains multiple audio streams. \n    * Multiple audio streams will cause ingestion problems.\n  * Please correct the number of audio channels. The audio has more than 2 channels. Only 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo) are supported.\n\n#### Incorrect video settings\n\nYour encoder is sending incorrect video settings. Correct the error messages to make sure your video is delivered properly.\n\n  * Please provide one video stream. The ingestion stream contains no video stream.\n  * Please provide only one video stream. The ingestion stream contains multiple video streams.\n  * The current video is interlaced, but interlaced video is not supported. \n    * Make sure your video is progressive. Otherwise you will see artifacts on the video which severely impact the quality.\n  * The current frame rate is too high. Please set the frame rate to X fps or less. \n    * Remember that your frame rate and keyframe frequency are linked. If you change your frame rate, you'll also need to change your keyframe frequency so that keyframes are delivered every 2 seconds.\n\n#### Incorrect video keyframe frequency\n\nYour encoder is sending keyframes too often or not often enough. Change so keyframes are sent every 2 seconds. At 30fps, that is every 60 frames.\n\n  * Please use a keyframe frequency of four seconds or less. Currently, keyframes are not being sent often enough, which can cause buffering. The current keyframe frequency is X seconds. Note that ingestion errors can cause incorrect GOP (group of pictures) sizes.\n  * The GOP (group of pictures) size is small, which can reduce image quality. The recommended keyframe frequency is four seconds. The current keyframe frequency is X seconds. Note that ingestion errors can cause incorrect GOP sizes. \n    * Some encoders allow you to change the \"GOP\" to Open (variable) or Closed (fixed). YouTube's pipeline requires a Closed GOP for optimal transcoding.\n\n#### Incorrect video size (resolution)\n\nYour video must be the height and width of the resolution you chose on the Ingestion Settings page. The correct sizes for each resolution are listed in the encoder settings as \"width x height\".\n\n  * Please check the video resolution. The current resolution is X, which is not optimal.\n  * You need to change the video resolution. The current resolution is X, which is not supported for this configuration. The expected video resolution is X.\n\n#### **Mismatched primary and backup streams**\n\nYour primary and backup streams must have the exact same settings for failover to work properly. Correct the error messages to make sure your primary and backup streams are matched.\n\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same resolution. The streams have different resolutions in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same video codecs. The streams have different video codecs in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same interlacing. The streams have different interlacing in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same profile. The streams have different profiles in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same bitrate. The streams have different bitrates in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same framerate. The streams have different framerates in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same keyframe frequency. The streams have different keyframe frequencies in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same audio sample rate. The streams have different audio sample rates in the current configuration.\n  * In the current configuration, the video's primary and backup streams use different audio channels. You need to configure the streams to have the same audio channel.\n  * Please configure the primary stream and backup stream of the video to have the same audio codecs. The streams have different audio codecs in the current configuration.\n  * Please configure both primary and backup streams correctly.

Additionally, we will pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia. As a result, creators in Russia won\u2019t be able to complete new YPP sign-ups at this time.\n\n**March 3, 2022:** Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google and YouTube ads from serving to users located in Russia.

These include policies described below, as well as YouTube\u2019s Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, Copyright, Rights Clearance Adjustment policies, and our program policies.\n\nThese policies apply to anyone in, or looking to apply to, the YouTube Partner Program. The YouTube Shorts monetization policies also apply if you\u2019re monetizing Shorts on YouTube.\n\nAll content monetizing with ads must follow our advertiser-friendly content guidelines. To earn revenue from fan funding features, first time users must accept the Commerce Product Module (CPM) before turning on the individual features. You must also follow the Commerce Products monetization policies when monetizing with fan funding features.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of each major policy. Make sure you read each policy thoroughly, as these policies are used to check if a channel is suitable to monetize. Our reviewers regularly check to see whether monetizing channels follow these policies. Learn more about how we enforce our policies.\n\nKeep in mind that when we use the term **video** on this page, it refers to Shorts, long-form videos, and live streaming. These policies apply wherever videos are viewed including the Watch Page (pages within YouTube, YouTube Music, or YouTube Kids), the YouTube Video Player (player that embeds YouTube content on other sites), and the YouTube Shorts Player (player that makes Shorts available).\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392\n\n[CATEGORY] Policies & eligibility\n\n\n"

This policy is based on the Search Console portion of our program policies. We\u2019ve put it in a context that\u2019s more relevant for YouTube creators.\n\nThis policy applies to your channel as a whole. In other words, if you have many videos that violate our guidelines, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.\n\n#### What is allowed to monetize\n\nThis policy makes sure monetized content offers viewers something appealing and interesting to watch. In other words, if the average viewer can clearly tell that content on your channel differs from video to video, it's fine to monetize. We know many channels create content that follows a similar pattern. What\u2019s important is that the substance of each video should be relatively varied.\n\n**Examples of what is allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):**\n\n  * Same intro and outro for your videos, but the bulk of your content is different\n  * Similar content, where each video talks specifically about the qualities of the subject you\u2019re featuring\n  * Short clips of similar objects edited together where you explain how they\u2019re connected\n\n#### Content that violates this guideline\n\nWhen a channel\u2019s content consists of similar content, it can frustrate viewers who come to YouTube for appealing and interesting videos. That means channels where content is only slightly different from video to video are not allowed to monetize. In other words, your channel shouldn\u2019t consist of content that\u2019s automatically created or produced using a basic template.\n\n**Examples of what\u2019s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):**\n\n  * Content that exclusively features readings of other materials you did not originally create, like text from websites or news feeds\n  * Songs modified to change the pitch or speed, but are otherwise identical to the original\n  * Similar repetitive content, or mindless content with low educational value, commentary, or narrative\n  * Templated, mass-produced, or programmatically generated content\n  * Image slideshows or scrolling text with minimal or no narrative, commentary, or educational value\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392\n\n[CATEGORY] Policies & eligibility\n\n\n"

        "content": "# YouTube channel monetization policies\n\n## What we check when we review your channel\n\n### Reused content\n\nReused content refers to channels that repurpose someone else's content without adding significant original commentary or educational value. This policy is taken from the Search Console portion of our program policies. We\u2019ve put it in a context that\u2019s more relevant for YouTube creators.\n\nThis policy applies to your channel as a whole. In other words, if you have many videos that violate our guidelines, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.\n\n#### What is allowed to monetize\n\nThe spirit of this policy is to make sure we\u2019re rewarding creators for original and authentic content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content you didn\u2019t originally create, you\u2019ve transformed the content in some way. It\u2019s fine to have this type of content on your channel, but individual videos may be subject to other policies like copyright. In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there\u2019s a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.\n\n**Note** : While these examples do not violate the reused content monetization policy, other policies, such as copyright, still apply.\n\n**Examples of what\u2019s allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):**\n\n  * Using clips for a critical review\n  * A scene from a movie where you\u2019ve rewritten the dialog and changed the voiceover\n  * Replays of a sports tournament where you explain the moves a competitor did to succeed\n  * Reaction videos where you comment on the original video\n  * Edited footage from other creators where you add a storyline or commentary\n  * Remixed content on Shorts where you add original content to a song from our library, or the original audio or video segment from other videos\n\n#### Content that violates this guideline\n\nTaking someone else\u2019s content, making minimal changes, and calling it your own original work would be a violation of this guideline. This policy applies even if you have permission from the original creator. Reused content is separate from YouTube\u2019s Copyright enforcement, which means it\u2019s not based on copyright, permission, or fair use. This guideline means sometimes, you may not get claims against your content, but your channel may still violate our reused content guidelines.\n\n**More examples of what\u2019s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):**\n\n  * Clips of moments from your favorite show edited together with little or no narrative\n  * Short videos you compiled from other social media websites\n  * Collections of songs from different artists (even if you have their permission)\n  * Content uploaded many times by other creators\n  * Promotion of other people\u2019s content (even if you have permission)\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392\n\n[CATEGORY] Policies & eligibility\n\n\n"

We will consider each principle as a factor for monetization eligibility on a rolling basis. We currently enforce against the low-quality principles for kids and family content listed below. We may increase the scope to include more quality principles over time.\n\n  * **Encouraging negative behaviors or attitudes** : Content that encourages dangerous activities, wastefulness, bullying, dishonesty, or a lack of respect for others (e.g. dangerous/unsafe pranks, unhealthy eating habits).\n  * **Heavily commercial or promotional:** Content that is primarily focused on purchasing products or promoting brands and logos (e.g., toys and food). It also includes content that is focused on excessive consumerism. Learn more about overly commercial content for YouTube Kids.\n  * **Deceptively educational** : Content that claims to have educational value in its title or thumbnail, but actually lacks guidance or explanation, or is not relevant to children. For example, titles or thumbnails that promise to help viewers \u201clearn colors\u201d or \u201clearn numbers,\u201d but instead the video features inaccurate info.\n  * **Hindering comprehension** : Content that is thoughtless, lacks a cohesive narrative, or is incomprehensible, such as having inaudible audio. This type of video is often the result of mass production or auto-generation.\n  * **Sensational or misleading** : Content that is untrue, exaggerated, bizarre, or opinion-based, and may confuse a young audience. It might also include \u201ckeyword stuffing\u201d, or the practice of using popular keywords of interest to children in a repetitive, altered, or exaggerated way.

This does not apply to poetry and spoken word performances.  \nEducational |  \u201cEducational\u201d refers to informing or teaching about a subject without deliberately misinforming the audience. Educational content expresses an opinion in a neutral way, such as in a discussion of safe sex practices. The following terms are contextually related:\n\n  * \u201cDocumentary\u201d refers to memorializing and preserving historic events by quoting original documents or describing facts, such as in a history of Ancient Egypt.\n  * \u201cScientific\u201d refers to advancing inquiry through scientific experimentation and theory, such as when presenting data on human psychology.\n\nArtistic | \u201cArtistic\u201d refers to art intended to express human creativity such as painting, drawings, architecture, sculpture, literature, poetry, music, performing, and scripted content. An example would be a video of a poetry recital.  \nDramatized |  \u201cDramatized\u201d refers to scripted content such as movies or fictional settings including animated content.  \nGraphic, Graphicness |  \"Graphic\u201d or \u201cgraphicness\u201d refers to inclusions of explicit and realistic portrayals such as the following:\n\n  * Gore or open wounds resulting from violent acts, like street fights.\n  * Violent acts against animals, like kicking.\n  * Visuals of sexual acts, sexual body parts and fluids.\n\nRealism |  \u201cRealism\u201d refers to three levels of severity:\n\n  * \u201cLow realism\u201d: Highly divergent from reality, such as a talking cat.\n  * \u201cModerate realism\u201d: Low divergence from reality, such as exaggerated graphics depicting real-world figures such as humans or animated characters in video games.\n  * \u201cHigh realism\u201d: Real-world situations depicting humans as main characters, such as a street fight.\n\nExplicit, Explicitness |  \u201cExplicit\u201d or \u201cexplicitness\u201d refer to how present or visible the violative subject is in content. Some examples include:\n\n  * Video showing or depicting an abortion procedure.\n  * Audio or sounds of someone getting abused.\n\nImplicit, Implied |  \u201cImplicit\u201d or \u201cimplied\u201d refer to a suggestive, indirect presence or visibility of the violative subject.

For example, briefly acknowledging a controversial or sensitive topic (e.g. \u201cIn next week\u2019s video we\u2019ll be discussing declining rates of suicide.\u201d) wouldn\u2019t be considered focal, but a segment of a video specifically talking about such a topic would be considered focal.

        "content": "# Learn more about how YouTube works for you\n\n### Your content on YouTube\n\n#### YouTube Search\n\nYouTube Search prioritizes a few main elements to give the best search results, including relevance, engagement, and quality. To estimate relevance, we look into many factors, such as how well the title, tags, description, and video content match a viewer\u2019s search query. Engagement signals are a valuable way to figure out relevance and we incorporate aggregate engagement signals from users. For example, we may look at the watch time of a particular video for a particular query to figure out whether other users consider the video to be relevant to the query. For quality, our systems are designed to identify signals that can help determine which channels demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness on a given topic. YouTube doesn't accept payment for better placement within organic search results.\n\nIn areas such as music or entertainment, we often use extra factors like freshness or popularity to help our systems connect users to quality content they\u2019ll enjoy. In other areas where credibility is key, including news, politics, and medical or scientific info, we work hard to make sure that our search systems prioritize surfacing high-quality and authoritative content from trusted sources.\n\nOfficial Cards also make it easier for users to discover content by highlighting official material in YouTube Search. These cards include official videos and posts from top channels, like those of top YouTube creators, celebrities, and music artists. Videos and posts are also included from content related to sports teams, movies and TV, music, and special events. These cards are automatically generated and don't allow for customization.\n\nOur goal is to give you the resources to help you understand the factors we consider to provide the best search results for users.\n\n#### More resources\n\n  * Help Center - Discovery Optimization Tips\n  * Help Center - Search & Discovery FAQs\n  * Help Center - Official Cards\n\n#### Recommended videos\n\nWe start with the knowledge that everyone has unique viewing habits. Our system then compares a user\u2019s viewing habits with those that are similar. The system uses that info to suggest other content the viewer may want to watch.\n\nOur recommendation system is constantly evolving, learning every day from over 80 billion pieces of info we call signals, the primary ones being:\n\n  * **Watch history:** Our system uses the YouTube videos viewers watch to give them better recommendations, remember where they left off, and more.\n  * **Search history:** Our system uses what a viewer searches for on YouTube to influence future recommendations.\n  * **Channel subscriptions:** Our system uses info about the YouTube channels a viewer is subscribed to to recommend other videos they may like.\n  * **Likes:** Our system uses likes info to try to predict the likelihood that a viewer will be interested in similar videos in the future.\n  * **Dislikes:** Our system uses videos a viewer disliked to inform what to avoid recommending in the future.\n  * **\u201cNot interested\u201d feedback selections:** Our system uses videos viewers mark as \u201cNot interested\u201d to inform what to avoid recommending in the future. \n  * **\u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d feedback selections:** Our system uses \u201cDon\u2019t recommend channel\u201d feedback selections as a signal that the channel content likely isn\u2019t something a viewer enjoyed watching.\n  * **Satisfaction surveys** : Our system uses user surveys that ask viewers to rate videos that they watched, which helps the system understand satisfaction, not just watch time.\n\nDifferent YouTube features rely on certain recommendation signals more than others. For example, we use the video a viewer is currently watching as the main signal when suggesting a video to play next. To provide video recommendations on the homepage, we primarily rely on a viewer\u2019s watch history. Viewers can turn off and clear their watch history if they don\u2019t prefer to see recommendations on their homepage. For people with YouTube watch history off and no significant prior watch history, the homepage will continue to show the search bar and the left-hand Guide menu. \n\n#### Reducing the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation \n\nOur commitment to openness means we may have content available on the platform that comes close to violating our policies, but does not quite cross the line. We think it\u2019s important to protect freedom of expression, but we set a high bar for what videos we display prominently in our recommendations on the YouTube homepage, or through the \u201cUp next\u201d panel. \n\nThat's why we take the additional step of recommending authoritative videos to viewers on topics such as news, politics, medical, and scientific info.\n\nWe rely on human evaluators, trained using publicly available guidelines, who assess the quality of info in each channel and video. To decide if a video is authoritative, evaluators look at factors like the expertise and reputation of the speaker or channel, the main topic of the video, and whether the content delivers on its promise or achieves its goal. The more authoritative a video, the more it\u2019s promoted in recommendations. We're constantly working to improve our systems to better raise up content from authoritative sources, like news outlets and health institutions. \n\n#### More resources\n\n  * Help Center - Discovery Optimization Tips\n  * Help Center - Search & Discovery FAQs\n  * Continuing Our Work to Improve Recommendations on YouTube\n  * Find your channel or video in search results\n  * 'What to Watch Next' Module\n  * Pick a strategy for reaching global audiences\n  * Your Content & Restricted Mode\n  * Music Charts and Insights on YouTube\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9962575\n\n[CATEGORY] Policies & eligibility\n\n\n"

For example, information about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace, election results, or census participation that contradicts official government records. Content which cites false claims in this area while making it clear that they are false, such as commentary, educational, or documentary content may earn ad revenue.\n\nWe haven\u2019t changed how we enforce this policy, which means there will be no difference in how your videos are checked for advertiser-friendliness.\n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines (September 2023)\n\nWe updated our guidelines about Controversial issues. \n\n  * **Allowing Creators to earn more ad revenue on content discussing topics such as abortion and adult sexual abuse.** This means that content which discusses these topics without going into graphic detail can fully monetize. We know that videos covering topics like these can be a helpful resource to users, so we want to ensure that wherever possible, Controversial issues discussed in a non-descriptive and non-graphic way aren't disincentivized through demonetization. We're also keenly aware that some creator communities feel like they get more yellow icons because they're uploading content about topics that disproportionately impact them. We hope these changes can give all Creators more space to discuss these topics, with eligibility for ad revenue. \n  * **Additionally** , **we\u2019re aligning our Advertiser-friendly content guidelines on****eating disorders****with****YouTube Community Guidelines**. Content which focuses on eating disorders and shares triggers like guides around binging, hiding, or hoarding food or abusing laxatives will not receive ad revenue. \n    * This change will ensure such content isn\u2019t incentivized with ads and that our monetization and community guidelines continue to be in sync. \n    * Note that educational or documentary content, and survivor content that references these aspects of having an eating disorder without promoting such activities won\u2019t be impacted by this change.\n\nThe Gaming and monetization article is also updated to reflect these policy updates.\n\nFor more info on this update, watch our Creator Insider video.\n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines (March 2023)\n\nWe\u2019ve updated our guidelines regarding Inappropriate language. Profanity (for example, the f-word) used in the first 7 seconds or majority of the video may earn limited ad revenue rather than no ad revenue, as previously announced below. Usage of words like \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cdouchebag\u201d, \"asshole\" and \u201cshit\u201d in the video content is eligible for green icons.

        "content": "# Upcoming and recent ad guideline updates\n\n## Previous updates\n\n### 2022\n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines (November 2022)\n\nWe\u2019ve updated our guidelines to include both clearer language, specific guidelines changes, and changes to ad suitabilities. See below for impacted guidelines as well as non-exhaustive examples of what is changing:\n\n  * **Adult content**\n    * Thumbnails, titles, and videos containing sexualized texts (such as links, 18+), obscene language, images (such as real or animated minimally covered butts ), audio (such as sharing sexual tips or working experiences), and gratifying acts (such as animal mating or implicit sexual acts) may not receive ad revenue.\n    * Policy enforcement around classical arts depicting sexual activities, sensual dancing, sexual educational without intent to arouse audiences remain unchanged and may receive ad revenue.\n  * **Violence**\n    * Non-graphic dead bodies presented without any context, game violence directed at a real named person or acts that are manufactured to create shocking experiences (such as brutal mass killing), implied moment of death (such as bombing a building with people inside) may not receive ad revenue.\n    * Standard game play where gory injuries are present after the first 8 seconds, non-graphic tragedies and their aftermath (such as footage of a town flooded), or police seizures as a part of law enforcement may receive ad revenue.\n  * **Harmful or dangerous acts**\n    * Dangerous acts where minors are participants or victims (such as minors participating in experiments or challenges involving stunts unsuitable for kids) may not receive ad revenue.\n  * **Sensitive events**\n    * All topics related to Drug Trade Organizations (DTO) and Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) will be located under **Harmful or dangerous acts** rather than **Sensitive events**.\n    * Language pertaining to Sensitive events has been updated to ensure it is clear and understandable, but policy enforcement is otherwise unchanged. \n  * **Inappropriate language**\n    * Our approach to profanity is changing. All varieties of profanity are now treated equally, meaning they are not differentiated based on levels of severity (for example, light, moderate, strong, or extreme) and we are not treating \u2018hell\u2019 and \u2018damn\u2019 as a profanity anymore. Therefore, profanity used in the title, thumbnails, or in the video's first 7 seconds or used consistently throughout the video may not receive ad revenue.\n    * Profanities used after the first 8 seconds may receive ad revenue. Our position on not monetizing content with profanity throughout or comprising the majority of the video is not changing.\n  * **Recreational drugs and drug-related content**\n    * Drug usage and consumption, like injections or joint smoking in gaming content, may not receive ad revenue. \n    * Drug dealings or mentions of drugs in gaming content may receive ad revenue.\n\nWe\u2019re also introducing new guidelines under the **Enabling dishonest behavior** guideline. The following content will now be in scope of \u201cThis content will earn no ad revenue\u201d: \n\n  * Pretending to be a retail store employee without the property owner\u2019s permission or violating their code of conduct (such as staying after their business hours). \n  * Using or encouraging the usage of hacking software in competitive e-sports.\n\nThe Gaming and monetization article has also been updated in parallel to reflect these policy updates.  \n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines (October 2022)\n\nThe Advertiser-friendly content guidelines page has been updated to make clear to the Creator community that today\u2019s video-level monetization guidelines outlined apply to both VOD (long-form video) and Shorts formats. There are no policy changes, which means you will not notice any difference in how your videos are checked for advertiser friendliness. We'll provide further updates when updates are made. You can learn more about when Shorts ad revenue sharing starts here.\n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines (August 2022)\n\nWe've updated monetization guidance around content that may be harmful or dangerous. Uploads showcasing vigilantism may not run ads. \n\nThe Advertiser-friendly content guidelines page has been updated to reflect this. There are no policy changes, which means you will not notice any difference in how your videos are checked for advertiser friendliness.\n\n#### Updates to the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines for inappropriate content for kids and families (April 2022)\n\nWe recently updated ad guidelines for \u201cmade for kids\u201d content to help guide creators on what is suitable and not suitable for ads. We\u2019ve created a new guideline called \u201cInappropriate content for kids and families\u201d that has three categories: Content that encourages negative behavior, Mature content aimed towards kids, and Shocking content aimed towards kids. \n\n#### Updates relating to the Ukraine war (March 2022)\n\nWe\u2019ve posted guidance on the Advertiser-friendly content guidelines page with respect to the ongoing war in Ukraine: \n\nDue to the war in Ukraine, content that exploits, dismisses, or condones the war is ineligible for monetization until further notice. This update is meant to clarify, and in some cases expand, our guidance as it relates to this war.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9725604\n\n[CATEGORY] Updates & FAQs\n\n\n"

Accepting the Base Terms is required to join or remain in YPP. \n\nShorts ad revenue sharing begins February 1, 2023. To start earning ad revenue on your Shorts views, monetizing partners will need to accept the Base Terms and Shorts Monetization Module. You will not be able to earn from Shorts Feed ads until you do so. Shorts views accrued prior to accepting the Shorts Monetization Module are not eligible for Shorts ad revenue sharing.\n\nTo remain in the YouTube Partner Program and continue monetizing on YouTube, all monetizing partners will have until July 10, 2023 to review and accept new terms. If you don\u2019t accept at least the Base Terms by that date, your channel will be removed from the YouTube Partner Program and your monetization agreement terminated. After that happens, you\u2019ll need to re-qualify and re-apply to join again. \n\nOnce your channel is removed from YPP, keep in mind that YouTube\u2019s Terms of Service still apply and govern your use of YouTube. This includes YouTube\u2019s right to monetize and display ads on your content. If you\u2019re currently not in the YouTube Partner Program, but you were previously, you may still see ads being served on your content, but won\u2019t be entitled to payment. \n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009\n\n[CATEGORY] Updates & FAQs\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Changes to YouTube Partner Program terms\n\n### What do the new \u201cNon-Qualifying Revenues\u201d terms mean for monetization?\n\nYouTube\u2019s terms help make sure we\u2019re providing an ecosystem where we can deliver value to advertisers and users, and responsibly and fairly reward creators. Instances of financial fraud, which unfairly capture earnings from fake views or purchases using stolen credit cards, hurt the ecosystem by creating loss of trust with advertisers, creators, and viewers. \n\nWhen we detect such abuse, we refund negatively impacted parties, such as advertisers or users, where appropriate and possible. YouTube does not keep this revenue, and creators should also not receive a share of any refunded revenue. Any actions we may take are proportional to the circumstances, as outlined under related policies. For example, while we may recoup and refund revenue resulting from financial fraud, we are not seeking to recoup revenue if videos are later found to not meet our advertiser-friendly content guidelines.\n\nThe \u201cNon-Qualifying Revenues\u201d section of the new YouTube Partner Program terms doesn\u2019t reflect new policies. This section is instead aimed at bringing more transparency around our existing Program policies about changes or delays to payments in instances such as financial fraud. \u201cNon-Qualifying Revenues\u201d covers 2 different scenarios where we may recoup revenue in the event of specific violations like invalid traffic:\n\n  1. YouTube may withhold or adjust any partner earnings associated with a breach of the terms. \n    1. For example, if we detect financial fraud before payment is made, we may adjust the payment to remove the associated revenue or withhold payment for that portion of revenue while we investigate the fraud. \n  2. YouTube may charge back or offset such amounts against future partner earnings payable to you. \n    1. For example, if we detect financial fraud after payment is made, the associated revenue could be charged back against any AdSense for YouTube balance that has not yet been disbursed, or otherwise offset or deducted from future earnings. When this happens, chargebacks are deducted from your AdSense for YouTube balance, not your bank account.\n\nThere is no change to how we process revenue for Content ID claims between monetizing partners. In these cases, we will continue to withhold revenue while a dispute is in progress.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009\n\n[CATEGORY] Updates & FAQs\n\n\n"

        "content": "# U.S. tax requirements for YouTube earnings\n\n### Where U.S. tax requirements apply\n\nEvery YPP creator, regardless of their location in the world, is required to provide U.S. tax info to Google. Under U.S. tax law, Google is required to deduct taxes from your YouTube earnings from U.S. viewers, if applicable. The tax withholding requirements can differ depending on your country of residence, whether you're eligible to claim tax treaty benefits, and whether you identify as an **Individual** or a **Business**.\n\n  * **Creators outside of the U.S:** If you submit U.S. tax info, withholding rates are between 0-30% on earnings you generate from viewers in the U.S. and depend on whether your country has a tax treaty relationship with the United States. \n  * **U.S. creators:** Google _will not_ withhold taxes on earnings if you have provided valid tax info. Most U.S. creators already have submitted their U.S. tax info.\n\n**Important** : If no U.S. tax info is provided, Google may be required to withhold using the maximum tax rate. Your tax rate will depend on your AdSense for YouTube account type and country:\n\n  * **_Business_** _account type:_ the default withholding rate will be 30% of U.S. earnings if the payee is outside of the U.S. Businesses in the U.S. will be subject to 24% withholding on total earnings worldwide.\n  * **_Individual_** _account type:___ backup withholding will apply and 24% of total earnings worldwide will be withheld.\n\nThese withholding rates will be adjusted in the next payment cycle once valid U.S. tax info is provided in AdSense for YouTube. You can follow these instructions to determine which account type your AdSense or AdSense for YouTube account is.\n\n**Important** : Google will never send unsolicited messages asking for your password or other personal info. Before clicking a link, always check that the email is sent from an **@youtube.com** or **@google.com** email address.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10391362\n\n[CATEGORY] Understand your earnings\n\n\n"

        "content": "# U.S. tax requirements for YouTube earnings\n\n### How will this affect my income on YouTube?\n\nOnly the portion of your earnings from viewers in the United States will be subject to tax withholding and reporting if you provide valid tax information.  \n\nThe exact rate of tax withholding will be determined by the tax info you provide to Google. You can view your tax withholding rate in the Manage tax info section in your AdSense for YouTube Payment Settings once you submit your form. Tax withholding amounts are not visible in YouTube Analytics.\n\n**Hypothetical example**\n\nHere\u2019s a hypothetical example: a YouTube creator in India in the YouTube Partner Program earns $1,000 USD from YouTube in the last month. Of the $1,000 USD, their channel generated $100 USD from U.S. viewers.\n\nHere are some possible withholding scenarios:\n\n  * **Creator doesn\u2019t submit tax info:** the final tax deduction is $240 USD because the withholding tax rate is up to 24% of total earnings worldwide if they didn't submit tax info. This means that until the creator submits complete tax info, we\u2019ll need to deduct up to 24% of their total earnings worldwide, not just their U.S. earnings.\n  * **Creator submits tax info and claims a treaty benefit:** the final tax deduction is $15 USD. This is because India and the U.S. have a tax treaty relationship that reduces the tax rate to 15% of earnings from viewers in the U.S.\n  * **Creator submits tax info, but is not eligible for a tax treaty benefit:** the final tax deduction will be $30 USD. This is because the tax rate without a tax treaty is 30% of earnings from viewers in the U.S.\n\n**Calculate your estimated tax withholding**\n\nSee how your YouTube income may be affected with the following example calculation:\n\n  1. Access the Revenue Report in YouTube Analytics and set the date filter to the relevant payment period (e.g. Oct 1 - 31). It may be helpful to set your YouTube Analytics to the currency you are paid in (e.g. USD).\n  2. Apply a geography filter to see estimated revenue from the United States. Learn more about your Audience in YouTube Analytics.\n  3. Go to your AdSense for YouTube account to find your tax withholding rate. Your withholding rate is visible after submitting your U.S. tax info.\n  4. Multiply the results of steps 2 and 3 above.\n\nNote that following the above only produces an estimate of tax withholding. Once Google begins withholding taxes, you will see the finalized amount withheld in your regular Payments Transactions Report in AdSense for YouTube (if any apply).\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10391362\n\n[CATEGORY] Understand your earnings\n\n\n"

If you have further questions, you may want to seek professional tax advice.\n\n#### Why are there multiple payment types and which do I select?\n\nPayments made in relation to Google products can sometimes fall into multiple categories. YouTube, AdSense, and Play partners should select all income types for which they\u2019re eligible to claim treaty benefits to ensure they receive appropriate withholding tax rates. Google withholds at the appropriate rate based on the income type being paid and corresponding treaty claim. Google won\u2019t use additional treaty claims unless such income type is paid.

Now, when you turn on ads for new long-form videos, we show your viewers pre-roll, post-roll, skippable, or non-skippable ads when appropriate. This change makes the recommended best practice to turn on all ad formats, the standard for everyone. Your choices for mid-roll ads haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve also retained your ad choices for existing long-form videos, unless you change the monetization settings.\n\nWhen you turn on monetization for your channel, you can choose to share in revenue from ads being served on the Watch Page or in the Shorts Feed. Ads are served through the ads auction, Google Ad Manager, and other YouTube-sold sources. Once you turn on monetization, it may take some time for ads to show up.\n\nThe ads on your video are automatically chosen based on context like your video metadata and whether the content is advertiser-friendly.\n\nWe regularly monitor and update our systems to deliver the most relevant ads to your videos. However, we don't manually control every ad that shows with your videos, so we can't guarantee that we\u2019ll play specific ads.\n\nAds will not always show on monetized videos.

To qualify for partner-sold ads, organizations must distribute content across different platforms and have the company infrastructure (including sales forces) to sell ads against their videos.\n\nFor partner-sold ads, the partners work directly with advertisers to serve ads on content they own. Advertisers buy ads from these partners so that the ads show up on specific content.

You can also see the expected monetization status and revenue potential in real time.\n\n**For creators with a high accuracy rating history** : We\u2019ll use your input for the initial monetization decision. Then you can publish and monetize your video immediately after you upload it. If our systems find any discrepancies with your rating, there\u2019s a small chance it could change. Most discrepancies are found within one hour.\n\n**For creators that are new to Self-Certification or have a low accuracy rating history** : We\u2019ll rely more on our automated systems for monetization decisions. There\u2019s also a \u2018checking\u2019 monetization icon to make it clear when a review is still in progress. Videos can\u2019t be monetized with ads until system checks are complete.\n\nTo check your rating history, check out Understand your rating status.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7561938\n\n[CATEGORY] Ads monetization\n\n\n"

You can either publish, edit the video and re-upload it, or request a human review of your content.\n\n**Red** : You turned on monetization, but because there\u2019s a copyright claim on the video, it can\u2019t be monetized. Sometimes, you can file a dispute.\n\n**Gray** : You chose not to turn on monetization for this video.\n\n**Checking** : System checks are still running. You can still make a video public while checks are running, but we recommend waiting for it to complete before publishing. To maximize revenue, wait until this icon is replaced with either a green, yellow, or red icon, which means the check is complete.

You or your channel members can buy gift memberships during live streams or Premieres.\n\nIf you offer a membership tier below $5, promotional gift memberships may be available for you to distribute to viewers each month. Promotional gift memberships are free of charge, and you don\u2019t earn revenue on these gift memberships. Promotional gift memberships are available on the first of each month, and do not carry over month to month. You must distribute the promotional gift memberships before you can buy gift memberships for your viewers. You can distribute the promotional gift memberships, in sets of 5, the same way you distribute gift memberships you buy during live streams or Premieres: To see your promotional gift memberships, go to a live stream or Premiere live chat and Select **Membership gifting** **Gift 5 now.**\n\n**Note** : Promotional gift memberships are not currently available for brand accounts. Stay tuned as we expand more broadly in the coming months.\n\nWhen you or a channel member buys gift memberships, a countdown ticker will highlight the purchase in live chat for a limited amount of time. The amount of time depends on the purchase amount. If the live chat or live stream ends before the gift is announced, it will still be distributed to viewers.\n\nViewers must opt in to be eligible for gift memberships. Once a viewer opts-in to allow gifts on your channel, they\u2019re eligible to get gift memberships on any current or future gifts on your channel.\n\nYou can encourage viewers to opt in for gifts by sharing your unique opt-in URL across your channel and content:\n\n  * www.youtube.com/channel/{external_channel_id}/allow_gifts, OR\n  * www.youtube.com/channel/{channel_name}/allow_gifts\n\nYou can find your unique external channel ID here.\n\n\u200b\u200bA gift membership purchase is considered fulfilled once YouTube distributes the first gift to a viewer.

The badge times count how long each member has cumulatively paid for a membership. For example, if an active member joined your channel a year ago, but only paid for a total of 9 months out of the past 12 months, their badge will show that they have been a member for 9 months. Here are the durations associated with each of the 8 badges: \n\n  * New\n  * 1 month\n  * 2 months\n  * 6 months\n  * 1 year\n  * 2 years\n  * 3 years\n  * 4 years\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7544492\n\n[CATEGORY] Channel memberships\n\n\n"

        "content": "# YouTube Shorts monetization policies\n\n## How ad revenue sharing works for Shorts\n\nOnly monetizing partners who\u2019ve accepted the Shorts Monetization Module can earn ad revenue from Shorts.\n\nThere are four steps to how Shorts ad revenue sharing works:\n\n  1. **Pool Shorts Feed ad revenue.** Each month, revenue from ads running between videos in the Shorts Feed gets added together and used to both reward creators and help cover costs of music licensing.   \n\n  2. **Calculate the Creator Pool.** Shorts Feed ad revenue is then allocated into the **Creator Pool** based on views and music usage across Shorts uploaded by monetizing creators. \n     * **If a monetizing creator uploads a Short without any music** , _all_ of the revenue associated with its views goes into the Creator Pool.\n     * **If a monetizing creator uploads a Short with music in it** , then YouTube will split the revenue associated with its views between the Creator Pool and music partners based on the number of tracks used.\n\nFor example, if a monetizing creator uploads a Short with 1 track, half of the revenue associated with its views would be allocated to the Creator Pool, and the other half used to cover the costs of music licensing. If the Short features 2 music tracks, then one third of the revenue associated with its views would be allocated to the Creator Pool, and the other two thirds used to cover the costs of music licensing. \n  3. **Allocate the Creator Pool.** From the overall amount in the Creator Pool, revenue is distributed to monetizing creators based on their share of total views from monetizing creators\u2019 Shorts in each country. For example, if a creator gets 5% of all eligible Shorts views uploaded by monetizing creators, they\u2019ll be allocated 5% of the revenue in the Creator Pool.  \n\n  4. **Apply revenue share.** Monetizing creators will keep 45% of their allocated revenue, regardless if music was used or not.\n\nWhat\u2019s not included in the Creator Pool:\n\n  * Revenue associated with views of Shorts uploaded by creators who haven\u2019t yet accepted the Shorts Monetization Module, or aren\u2019t yet eligible to monetize their Shorts. This revenue will be used to cover the costs of music licensing and/or be retained by YouTube. \n  * Revenue associated with views of Shorts uploaded by music partners.\n  * Revenue associated with views of Shorts that are determined to be ineligible.\n\n  * Revenue associated with any ads shown upon opening the Shorts Feed before a Short is viewed (e.g. the YouTube Shorts Masthead).\n  * Revenue associated with any ads shown on navigational pages within the Shorts player.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12504220\n\n[CATEGORY] Shorts\n\n\n"

    {
        "content": "# YouTube Shorts monetization policies\n\n## How ad revenue sharing works for Shorts\n\n### Understand with an example\n\nLet\u2019s review a hypothetical example to better understand how this works.\n\n**Hypothetical example**\n\nAs a monetizing creator, let\u2019s say you upload a Short that uses 1 music track. Here\u2019s how we\u2019d calculate what your Short earns in Country A this month.\n\n  * There are 100 million total Shorts views in Country A, and all views are on Shorts uploaded by monetizing creators.\n  * $100,000 is earned from ads that play between Shorts in the Shorts Feed.\n  * 20% of these Shorts use 1 music track, so the Creator Pool is $90,000 and $10,000 is used to cover the costs of music licensing.\n  * Your Short is viewed 1 million times, so you are allocated 1% of the Creator Pool, or $900. Your allocation from the Creator Pool is not affected by your use of a music track.\n  * The 45% revenue share is then applied to your allocation, and you earn $405 for your Shorts views in Country A.\n\n#### Use of third-party content in Shorts\n\nIn certain circumstances, when a Short features third-party content or remixed content, the views allocated to the Short will be divided between the uploader and any third-party rightsholders (owners of other content used in a Short) for the purposes of calculating the Creator Pool and revenue share to monetizing creators. The following policies describe how this will occur. We may update these policies and will inform you of any changes.\n\n  * **How use of third-party content affects the Creator Pool.** When the amount of the Creator Pool is calculated, **only music content** made available by YouTube's music industry partners or generated by Dream Track will be credited as making a contribution to a Short. This means that only when music content is used in a Short will it reduce the amount of views and associated revenue allocated to the Creator Pool. No other category of third-party content will be credited as making a contribution to a Short at this time, even when a Content ID monetize policy is set on that content. However, we are in the early stages of developing our monetization model for other categories of content. \n    * The examples above show how views and associated revenue are split to calculate the Creator Pool when music content is used in a Short.\n  * **How use of third-party content affects allocations from the Creator Pool.** When paying monetizing creators their share from the Creator Pool, each monetizing creator will be allocated 100% of the total number of views on their Shorts, regardless of whether any music (including music generated by Dream Track) is used in the Short. As a result, using music in a Short won't affect a creator\u2019s allocation from the Creator Pool or their revenue share rate.\n\n#### YouTube Premium subscription revenue sharing for Shorts\n\nYouTube Premium is a paid subscription option which enables users to enjoy ad-free content, background playback, downloads, and premium access to the YouTube Music app. This offering also applies to views on Shorts. \n\nYouTube will pay 45% of the net revenue from YouTube Premium that is allocated to monetizing creators for Shorts. A portion of YouTube Premium revenues are allocated to help cover costs of music licensing. Payments to each creator are based on their share of subscription Shorts views within each country.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12504220\n\n[CATEGORY] Shorts\n\n\n"

When your earnings reach the verification threshold, Google sends a unique 6-digit Personal Identity Number (PIN) to your payments address through international standard mail. Google doesn't provide a tracking number for the PIN mail, so make sure your payments address can receive standard mail. **Note** : If we've asked you to verify your identity, we won't send your PIN until after you've successfully completed identity verification. \n  3. It usually takes 3 weeks for your PIN mail to arrive. If you haven\u2019t received your PIN mail in 3 weeks, please request a replacement PIN.\n  4. When you receive your PIN mail, follow these steps to verify your payments address immediately: \n    1. Sign in to your AdSense account.\n    2. Click **Payments** **Verification check**.\n    3. Enter the PIN exactly as it appears in your PIN mail. **Note** : If you enter your PIN incorrectly 3 times, your account will stop showing ads. \n    4. Click **Submit**.\n\nYour payments address is now verified. You'll be paid out when your account balance reaches the payments threshold, as long as there are no holds on your account and you're in compliance with the AdSense Program policies.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157667\n\n[CATEGORY] AdSense\n\n\n"

It\u2019s important that we quickly address invalid traffic to keep the platform working for creators, advertisers, and viewers. By continuing to protect our advertising systems against invalid traffic, advertisers can continue to be confident investing in the platform, which helps creators monetize the great content they produce. \n\nSometimes, creators may find that their channels are affected by invalid traffic, even if they\u2019re not intentionally driving it. This means that there are times when creators may not be aware that activity they\u2019ve received is the result of invalid traffic.\n\nWhile we work hard to try to prevent it, some types of invalid traffic can only be detected by our systems after it happens. As a result, adjustments are made to views and earnings in YouTube Analytics and AdSense for YouTube. When you see these adjustments, it means that our invalid traffic defenses are working to protect the platform, even if you didn't necessarily generate or drive that traffic.\n\nFor more info on invalid traffic, check out the YouTube Community Help Forum.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10285842\n\n[CATEGORY] Payment issues\n\n\n"

Avoid partnering with untrusted parties for video creation and building your channel. For example, it\u2019s best to avoid services that claim to increase your views, likes, or subscriptions. Even when third parties say they drive real traffic to your channel, it may be artificial, resulting in invalid traffic. \n  2. Don\u2019t click ads on your videos, even if you think it might be OK to do so. Our systems recognize when creators click the ads on their own videos. If this behavior happens consistently over time, your account may be disabled to protect both advertisers and the creator ecosystem.\n  3.

To show ads for these products or services, advertisers need to prove that they have a license or that they are registered with the appropriate organization.\n\nFor example, we have certification programs for advertisers who want to show ads for healthcare and medicine, gambling, financial services, and other topics. Based on the topic, we may work with experts to confirm that the advertiser meets the current standards for their industry, and whether they have the appropriate license. What advertisers can show also depends on the laws or policies in the country where the advertiser is located, or where their ads show.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9823520\n\n[CATEGORY] Advertiser info & policies\n\n\n"

Only \u201cof age\u201d viewers can view this content while signed in to YouTube. Sometimes, a video has to be age-gated before an advertiser can use it in an ad (like a Promoted Videos ad for an alcohol campaign). The YouTube Age Gate is the only option available to age-gating requests on the video watch page.\n\n**Demographic targeting by age for ads:**\n\nOur policies or advertisers sometimes ask for an ad to be targeted to a certain age demographic. Our ad serving technology can target these ads based on the birth dates of signed-in YouTube users. For example, if an ad isn\u2019t appropriate for a general audience under our policies, the ad has to be demo-targeted to 18+ viewers. This means that only signed-in viewers that are at least 18 years old will get this ad on our site. Signed-out viewers will get a different ad.\n\n**Custom-built Age Gates:**\n\nAlcohol, gaming, and movie advertisers can build custom age gates on homepage ads. We allow this because these are highly regulated industries, and the YouTube age gate may not meet industry regulations. For example, video game advertisers might need to meet ESRB guidelines on a mature-rated game. Requests for a custom age gate from these advertisers need to be submitted to the YouTube Ads Policy team for prior approval. Advertisers in all other verticals have to use the standard YouTube Age Gating features available on brand channels and video watch pages.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1304654\n\n[CATEGORY] Targeting & serving\n\n\n"

In other words, a single piece of intellectual property has up to three representations in the YouTube system:\n\n  * An **_asset_** is the representation of your intellectual property in the rights management system. You specify ownership and rights information as part of the asset.\n\n  * A **_reference_** is the representation of your intellectual property for Content ID matching. You provide a digital media file that Content ID compares to uploaded video content.\n\n  * A **_video_** is the representation of your intellectual property on youtube.com. The video\u2019s metadata describes the content and specifies how it appears on youtube.com. The video uses the same media file as a reference.\n\nThe asset is the heart of the system, the object with which the other objects are associated. You must create an asset for every piece of intellectual property; references and videos are optional.\n\nAn asset can have more than one reference associated with it. For example, a movie asset could have separate references with 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios.\n\nYou **link videos to assets** by claiming the video on behalf of the asset. You claim videos that you upload, and may also claim other users\u2019 videos when they include content that matches your asset.\n\nYou also create other supporting info, such as:\n\n  * Ownership provides information about the owner(s) of an asset or group of assets, such as the percentage of the asset that is owned and the territories where the asset is owned. You use ownership to declare who owns the rights to your assets.\n\n  * Rights policy define the conditions and rules for monetizing claimed videos. For example, you could define a policy that displays advertisements to viewers in the United States but only tracks viewers in the rest of the world.

        "content": "# Music Rights Management on YouTube\n\n### Asserting Ownership\n\nDecades ago, fans shared their favorite songs or performances on mixtapes. Today, that sharing and appreciation has moved online. Thousands of labels and rights holders have licensing agreements with YouTube to actually leave fan videos up and earn revenue from them. They agree that a world where fans express love for their favorite artists by uploading concert footage and remixes is something to be celebrated. And they see that fan-uploaded content can be a way to drive exposure and boost sales.\n\nAll of this is possible because Content ID automates rights management. When a fan uploads a video to YouTube, it is scanned against a database of content that has been provided by content owners. When it finds a match, it makes a claim on that video on behalf of the content owner and allows them to decide what they want to happen to that video. Only 0.5 percent of all music claims are issued manually; we handle the remaining 99.5 percent with 99.7 percent accuracy. Today, the revenue from fan-uploaded content accounts for 50 percent of music industry revenue on YouTube. \n\nContent ID has enabled YouTube to pay out billions of dollars to the music industry and that number is growing significantly year-on-year. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so surprising to see some labels and artists suggest that YouTube has allowed a flood of \u201cunlicensed\u201d music onto its platform, depriving artists of revenue. The truth is that YouTube takes copyright management extremely seriously and we work to ensure rights holders make money no matter who uploads their music. No other platform gives as much money back to creators-- big and small-- across all kinds of content.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7071269\n\n[CATEGORY] Understand YouTube rights management\n\n\n"

To be approved, you must own exclusive rights to a substantial body of original material that is frequently uploaded by the YouTube user community.\n\nYouTube also sets explicit guidelines on how to use Content ID. We monitor Content ID use and disputes on an ongoing basis to ensure these guidelines are followed.\n\nAs the copyright owner, you provide YouTube with a reference copy of your eligible content. YouTube uses the reference to scan uploaded videos for matching content. When a match is found, YouTube applies your preferred policy: to monetize, track, or block the video in question.\n\nThe major steps for using Content ID are:\n\n  1. Set up your content owner.\n\nWhen you've been approved for Content ID, your YouTube partner manager creates your content owner, which represents you in the YouTube content management system, and grants you access to the Content Manager tools in Creator Studio. You need to configure your content owner account. Depending on your needs, you may associate an AdSense for YouTube account with the content owner or grant additional users access to the Content Manager tools.\n\n  2. Deliver content to YouTube.\n\nYou add your copyrighted content to the YouTube content management system by delivering reference files (audio, visual, or audiovisual) and metadata that describes the content and which territories you own it in.\n\nFor each item you deliver, YouTube creates an asset in the content management system. Depending on the type of content and your chosen delivery method, YouTube also creates a viewable YouTube video, a reference for Content ID matching, or both.\n\n  3. Content ID scans user uploads and identifies matches.\n\nContent ID continuously compares new uploads to the references for your assets. Matching videos are automatically claimed on behalf of the asset, and your specified match policy is applied to the claimed videos before they are published on YouTube.\n\nContent ID also performs a \"legacy scan\" to identify matching videos uploaded before your asset was created. Recent uploads and popular videos are scanned first. \n  4. Manage and monitor your content.\n\nContent Manager includes a **To Dos** list for actions such as reviewing claims and resolving ownership conflicts.

        "content": "# Content ID for music partners\n\nThe features described in this article are available only to partners who use YouTube's Content ID matching system.\n\nYouTube's Content ID system enables music partners to easily identify and manage their music on YouTube. YouTube scans uploaded videos against a database of music that you've submitted. When content in a user-uploaded video matches a work that you own, you get to decide whether to monetize the video, block it, or track it.\n\nTo use Content ID, you create assets in YouTube's rights management system. Each asset represents a piece of intellectual property. You can deliver four types of music assets:\n\n  * Music Video assets\n  * Sound Recording assets\n  * Composition **Share** assets\n  * Art Track assets\n\nYouTube also recognizes relationships between these assets. A Music Video asset may embed a Sound Recording asset, and a Sound Recording embeds one or more Composition Share assets.\n\nTo create assets, you upload the media files and their associated metadata using spreadsheet templates. You must only create assets for items you own the rights to; for example, music labels should not create Composition Share assets without an appropriate contract, and music publishers should not create Sound Recording assets.\n\nCreating a sound recording asset does not create an Art Track. To make the recording available as an Art Track, you must upload the recordings using the Art Track upload spreadsheet or the YouTube Music DDEX feed.\n\nUsing the references associated with your assets, Content ID identifies user-uploaded videos that include your copyrighted work and makes a claim that asserts your ownership of content within the video.\n\nWhen one of your assets claims ownership of a user-uploaded video, YouTube applies that asset's policy to the video. In cases where a Sound Recording asset and its embedded Composition Share assets have different policies, YouTube applies the most restrictive of the policies; see How policies are applied for more details.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2822002\n\n[CATEGORY] Learn about Content ID\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Content Manager responsibilities and feature access\n\n## What happens if you violate YouTube's policies\n\nContent managers who fail to follow YouTube\u2019s policies may receive official warnings if YouTube determines that their misuse of CMS is negligent, deliberate, or harmful. In addition, YouTube may remove any hosted or delivered content that violates YouTube\u2019s terms or policies. Official warnings may affect your company\u2019s eligibility for certain YouTube programs & CMS features, so it is important that you have adequate internal controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to your systems and comply with all of YouTube\u2019s policies, guidelines, and requirements.\n\n#### Losing access to CMS features\n\nIn addition to official warnings, partners who misuse or abuse CMS features may lose access to those features or other related features. This is usually temporary, and typically lasts for a set period of time. We may also temporarily restrict your access to CMS features to prevent imminent harm to the content management ecosystem. The amount of time a partner must wait before regaining access to a feature depends on a number of factors, such as the severity of the violation, the reason it occurred, the impact on a partner\u2019s business, and the partner\u2019s violation history. In some cases, we may deem that permanent loss of certain features is appropriate. Your partner manager will have information about the specific details and next steps. If you do not have a partner manager, you can contact the Creator Support team for more information.\n\n#### **Your responsibilities as a content manager**\n\nYouTube\u2019s Content Management System (CMS) is a powerful suite of tools that could harm the YouTube ecosystem if used improperly. Content managers are responsible for ensuring that all hosted and delivered content (such as channels, videos, art tracks, asset metadata, Content ID references, etc.) follow all of YouTube\u2019s policies and guidelines, including our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, monetization requirements, and content manager policies.\n\n#### Repeated and egregious violations\n\nWe take these policies very seriously. Partners who repeatedly or egregiously violate our content manager policies will face harsher penalties. These penalties may include losing access to additional CMS features, losing specific features for longer periods of time, or losing access to CMS entirely and termination of any contracts with YouTube.\n\nIn some cases, we may issue a \u201cfinal warning\u201d to comply with our policies. Content managers who are issued an official final warning notification will lose access to most of their CMS features until they can pass an abuse audit sometime within the following year. Any additional violations of our content manager policies in the following year, as well as failing to request and pass an abuse audit will put their contracts at risk of termination.\n\n#### Ownership of Multiple Content Owners\n\nNote that if you have a controlling stake in multiple content managers on YouTube, violations incurred in one content manager could result in penalties across all content managers under your ownership. \n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9142671\n\n[CATEGORY] Learn about Content ID\n\n\n"

Partners should avoid accumulating copyright strikes across their managed channels. Failure to do so will result in penalties applied to their content manager in addition to existing channel strike policies. Partner strike penalties limit access to features. This impacts both the content owner and associated content owners. \n\n#### Policy requirements:\n\nIf a partner receives 10 copyright strikes across managed channels in a 90 day period, then the partner is subject to further review, the results of which may include loss of the ability to link channels, loss of the ability to upload videos, and termination of the partnership agreement. After 90 days, copyright strikes will expire and be removed from the channel and content owner\u2019s total. YouTube also reserves the right to evaluate and address abuse at any time, at its discretion. \n\n#### What you can do to follow the policy:\n\n  * Use care when selecting new channels to manage.

See the manual action policy.  \nAll assets that are used to make manual claims must have accurate, human-readable metadata and valid reference content. | The only exception to this is where the reference material for the claimed content is unsuitable for matching or prohibited by our reference policy. While these assets do not require references, all claims must be for the same, distinct content and accurately described by the metadata. (e.g. no \u2018bucket' or 'catch-all' assets).  \nAssets used in manual claiming must accurately reflect the scope of your ownership. | For example, if you are a regional broadcaster claiming re-uploads of licensed content, you cannot use manual claiming to place a global block policy if you do not have global rights to that content.  \n\nAdditionally, broadcasters may have rights to show licensed content in a region, but that does not always mean they have rights to claim videos containing that content in that region.  \nAll manual claims must include accurate timestamps that identify where the claimed content exists in the video. | Individual matching segments must be specified with discrete timestamps.  \n\nDeliberately or repeatedly providing misleading timestamps may be considered a serious violation of our policies.  \nDon\u2019t manually claim content with a 'monetize' policy that violates YouTube\u2019s community or brand safety guidelines. | This may be considered a violation of our Circumventing Systems policy. Read more here.  \nManual claims on audio content that is only present in a small portion of a video may only use a monetize policy in very limited circumstances. | Generally, manual claims on short uses of audio content may only use a block or track policy unless the claimed content:  \n\u200bIs part of a video compilation, music countdown, or music-themed challenge. \n\n  * Is part of an intro/outro that is used to brand a channel.\n  * Is in a video that already has an existing, valid Content ID claim with a monetize policy.\n  * Is in a video uploaded to an Official Artist Channel represented by the claimant.\n  * Comprises the majority of the video.\n\nManual claims on \u201cunintentional use\u201d of audio content may not use the 'monetize' policy, but you may still generally apply the 'track' or 'block' policy on any use of your content. | For the purposes of this policy, we define \u201cunintentional use\u201d as instances where: \n\n  * The content was not added to the video by the creator AND\n  * There is no interaction between the creator and the content.\n\nSome examples of \u201cunintentional use\u201d are:\n\n  * Television heard from another room of the creator\u2019s house or office.\n  * Music from a passing car.\n\nExamples of where use is not considered unintentional include:\n\n  * Singing, dancing, or playing along to the music.\n  * Any content that is added in post-production or editing software.\n  * Background music in a place where the creator has direct control over the music, or the intent of the video is to capture the audio, such as a concert.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9142671\n\n[CATEGORY] Learn about Content ID\n\n\n"

        "content": "# What's new in Studio Content Manager\n\n## Previous updates\n\n### 2022\n\nWe're making a few improvements to the Content ID dispute and appeal process for both claimants and uploaders. These improvements came from feedback we\u2019ve heard over the years about the process. These changes may impact some of your workflows in Studio Content Manager. Here's what's changing:\n\n**1\\. Stronger eligibility requirements:** To reduce potential abuse of the appeal process, we're raising the requirements needed for users to submit Content ID appeals. From now on, the ability to submit an appeal will be gated by our advanced feature access, a feature we\u2019ve been introducing over the last couple of years which requires users to either provide identification or build their channel history over time to get access. Since this will likely lead to fewer and higher quality appeals, we\u2019re also shortening the timeframe to review Content ID appeals from 30 to 7 days. The standard appeal expiration will apply if no action is taken after 7 days. If the appeal is not reviewed in that 7-day period, you still have the ability to submit a takedown request at any time. You can find the appeals that need your review on your **Issues** page and can sort them by the appeal expiration date.   \n---  \n**2\\. Escalate to appeal:** Another change we're introducing for users with advanced feature access is \u201cEscalate to appeal\u201d. Eligible users looking to challenge **b****lock** claims on their videos will have the option to skip the initial dispute step and submit an appeal right away. Note that **m****onetize** and **track** claims aren't eligible for \u201cEscalate to appeal\u201d, only **block** claims are eligible.  Also keep in mind that your options for appeals, e.g. release the claim or issue a takedown request, aren't changing.   \n\nChannels you manage should also benefit from these changes since they'll now have faster resolution options for claims they wish to challenge.\n\n**These changes will start to go into effect on July 18, 2022**. Changes will only apply to disputes and appeals submitted after that date. To give you time to adjust your workflows, the changes will take effect gradually over time.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9082582\n\n[CATEGORY] Set up your Content Manager\n\n\n"

To create new assets or update existing assets, you need to upload a metadata file (a spreadsheet or an DDEX file) along with the media files for all of the assets.\n\nTo upload files using Package Uploader:\n\n  1. Click **Content delivery** in the left-side menu.\n\nIf you never used any of the Content Delivery features before, YouTube will automatically create an uploader account for you the first time you visit one of the Content Delivery pages. You can modify the email address or default channel for the uploader by going to **Uploader accounts** that can be found under **Settings** in the left-side menu\n\n  2.

Once added, the metadata file will automatically begin the validation process (a spinning icon will appear.) If needed, add all audio and video files to the package.\n\n  4. Fix any errors in your metadata file.\n\nIf the metadata contains an error that would prevent it from uploading successfully, a red icon will appear. Click the button to show the errors in this file.\n\n     * Edit the metadata in the original file. When finished, re-add the file to the Uploader page. If the filename does not change, YouTube will use the newer version of the file and restart the validation process.\n\nIf files are missing, add the files to the Uploader page. Validation will automatically restart. When the metadata file contains no errors, you can click the **Process package** button.\n\n  5. Click **Process package**.\n\nDepending on the number and size of files uploaded and the complexity of changes, it can take a couple of minutes to a couple of hours to finish processing a bulk upload.

        "content": "# Video and audio formatting specifications\n\n## Video formatting guidelines\n\nThe following guidelines describe the formatting specifications that yield the highest quality for playing videos on YouTube. YouTube encourages partners to upload videos that are as close to the original, high quality source format as possible to increase the likelihood that your videos will play in higher quality (HQ). Note that YouTube always re-encodes videos to optimize their playback quality.\n\n  * **File format:** YouTube prefers the original, 1080p HD broadcast format that you have in your digital content library, as well as DVD-compliant **MPEG-2** program streams saved with a **.MPG** extension. If you cannot submit videos in MPEG-2 format, then MPEG-4 is the preferred format. The following specifications provide optimal playback of MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 videos:\n\n    * **MPEG-2**\n\n      * **Audio codec:** MPEG Layer II or Dolby AC-3\n      * **Audio bitrate:** 128 kbps or better\n    * **MPEG-4**\n\n      * **Video codec:** H.264\n      * **Audio codec:** AAC\n      * **Audio bitrate:** 128 kbps or better\n  * **Minimum audio-visual duration:** 33 seconds (excluding black and static images in the video channel as well as silence and background noise in the audio channel)\n\n  * **Framerate:** Videos should be in their native frame rates without resampling. For film sources, a 24fps or 25fps progressive master yields the best results. Typically, frame rates are set at 24, 25 or 30 frames per second. Please do not use resampling techniques since they can cause images to shudder and often result in lower quality video. Examples of undesirable techniques include upsampling and transfer processes such as Telecine pulldown.\n\n  * **Aspect ratio:** Videos should be in their native aspect ratios, and uploaded videos should never include letterboxing or pillarboxing bars. The YouTube player automatically frames videos to ensure that they are displayed correctly, without cropping or stretching, regardless of the size of the video or player. See Advanced encoding for visual examples.\n\n    * If the video's native aspect ratio is 1.77:1 and the total frame size also has a 1.77:1 aspect ratio, use 16:9 matting with square pixels and no border.\n    * If the video's native aspect ratio is 1.77:1 and the total frame size does not have a 1.77:1 aspect ratio, use 16:9 matting with square pixels and a single-color border with no variations over time.\n    * If the video's native aspect ratio is 1.33:1 and the total frame size also has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, use 4:3 matting with square pixels and no border.\n    * If the video's native aspect ratio is 1.33:1 and the total frame size does not have a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, use 4:3 matting with square pixels and a single-color border with no variations over time.\n\nIf theatrical releases have a \"pan-and-scan\" version as well as the original 16:9 version, upload both versions separately.\n\n  * **Video resolution:** YouTube prefers high-definition videos and, in general, you should provide videos in the highest resolution available to provide the maximum degree of flexibility in the encoding and playback processes. For videos intended for sale or rental, you should provide a minimum resolution of 1920x1080 with a 16:9 aspect ratio. For content with or without ads, YouTube does not set a minimum resolution but recommends a resolution of at least 1280x720 for video that has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of at least 640x480 for video that has a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nYou may consider providing reduced quality videos if those videos will not be publicly visible on YouTube and are only being uploaded to serve as Content ID references. These videos can be a typical \"one quarter\" resolution \u2013 i.e. 320x240. However, the videos must be greater than 200 lines to yield effective references.\n\n  * **Video bitrate:** Since bitrate is highly dependent on codec, there is no recommended minimum value. Videos should be optimized for frame rate, aspect ratio and resolution rather than bitrate. Bitrates of 50 or 80Mbps are common for videos intended for sale or rental.\n\nIf you are unable to encode your videos using the preferred specifications, you can still submit your video in .WMV, .AVI, .MOV and .FLV formats. In this case, we recommend that you upload the highest quality video possible. YouTube will still accept your video content and then re-encode your video files as necessary. However, the quality of your videos may not be optimal and could make your videos ineligible for HQ encoding. If you are not able to encode your videos using the preferred specifications, we recommend that you upload a few test videos online to ensure that you are satisfied with the playback quality on YouTube.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/4603579\n\n[CATEGORY] Content delivery basics\n\n\n"

The FTC is currently considering various updates to COPPA, which may include providing more guidance on this issue. We\u2019ll also use machine learning systems to help us find content that is clearly made for kids. But please do not rely on our systems to set content for you -- like all automated systems, it\u2019s not perfect. We may need to override your audience setting choice in cases where we detect error or abuse. But in most cases, we\u2019ll rely on your audience setting to determine whether a video is made for kids. If you don\u2019t set your audience as made for kids, and the FTC or other authorities think it should have been, you may face legal consequences. So check out this Help Center article or seek legal counsel if you\u2019re still unsure whether or not your content should be set as made for kids.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9610989\n\n[CATEGORY] Spreadsheet templates\n\n\n"

This document describes specific requirements for the YouTube Music DDEX feed. For a general introduction to DDEX, see the Music Metadata Style Guide from the Music Business Association. For details about the DDEX ERN standard, see ddex.net. All feeds delivered to YouTube should follow either the Audio Album profile or the Single Resource Release profile, as published by DDEX.\n\nEvery DDEX ERN message includes four top-level elements:\n\n  * `<MessageHeader>` provides information about the message itself: a unique identification number, the sender and recipient, and a timestamp.\n  * `<ResourceList>` contains the details about the sound recordings and associated artwork.\n  * `<ReleaseList>` defines the releases that can be made from the resources in this message.\n  * `<DealList>` defines the key commercial information for each release, such as which territories the release can be made available in, usage rights, and start date for each release.\n\nDDEX Art Track packages are processed in the order they are received, based on the timestamp of the BatchComplete file that completes the package.\n\nIn accordance with the DDEX convention, the filename of the DDEX file needs to include the unique Release ID for the album. The Release ID is the UPC, EAN, or GRid provided by the `<ReleaseId>` element.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3503737\n\n[CATEGORY] Using the YouTube DDEX feed\n\n\n"

If you don\u2019t have a DDEX Party ID, you can apply for one at http://dpid.ddex.net/.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already upload batches of content to YouTube, you\u2019ll need to contact your partner representative to set up an SFTP or Aspera dropbox for you.\n\nWe recommend using a separate dropbox for DDEX ingestion apart from the one you may use for ContentID.\n\n  2. Validate and upload test batches.\n\nTo submit a test upload batch, set the `<MessageControlType>` in the message header to `TestMessage` and copy the DDEX file to your dropbox. See Uploading content for details. When you\u2019ve uploaded all of the files for the test, create a file whose name starts with the string \u201cBatchComplete\u201d, followed by any other characters and the file extension .xml. The presence of this file tells YouTube that the batch is ready.\n\nYouTube does not upload test messages, but only validates them. You don\u2019t need to include the media files when you upload a `TestMessage` for validation. \n\nSubmit test batches for all cases that your service supports:\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3498397\n\n[CATEGORY] Using the YouTube DDEX feed\n\n\n"

For example, if a release has 10 tracks:\n\n  * 1 x Audio Album feed for YouTube Premium containing all the tracks and the album metadata.\n  * 10 x Single Resource Release feeds with the Content ID rights for individual tracks.\n\nEven though this approach adds initial overhead, it reduces complexity in the case where tracks are shared across various albums and the Content ID rights are not tied to any one of the albums. Partners with smaller catalogs, where tracks appear on only one album, might opt to combine the feeds and deliver a single Audio Album feed.\n\n  * If you want to combine YouTube Premium and Content ID deliveries into a single Audio Album feed, make sure that the Content ID rights for any given track are only tied to one album. Content ID rights can\u2019t be spread across various feeds. If they are, the latest delivery will always overwrite all existing ownership/policies.\n  * If you deliver a Creator Music feed as the only MessageRecipient, the related Sound Recording asset(s) should already exist in our Content Manager. If you would like to deliver Creator Music license strategies for new assets, use a combined feed that includes at least Creator Music and Content ID.\n  * If all tracks on an album can be included in Creator Music, use one of the Audio Album profiles described below.\n\nFind the supported use cases and required MessageRecipients for each profile below:\n\n| **Audio Album profile** | **Single Resource Release Profile**  \n---|---|---  \n**YouTube Premium only** | Yes (MessageRecipient: **YouTube**) | No  \n**Content ID only** | Yes (MessageRecipient: **YouTube_ContentID**) | Yes  \n**YouTube Premium and Content ID** | Yes (MessageRecipients: **YouTube** and **YouTube_ContentID**) | No  \n**Creator Music only** | Yes (MessageRecipient: **YouTube_CreatorMusic**) | Yes  \n**YouTube Premium, Content ID, and Creator Music** | Yes (MessageRecipients: **YouTube** , **YouTube_ContentID** , and **YouTube_CreatorMusic**) | No  \n\nYou can download sample feeds for each use case from the DDEX Reference Resources page.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7161494\n\n[CATEGORY] Using the YouTube DDEX feed\n\n\n"

When preview details are communicated in your DDEX feed, a preview art track video is created and made available in the Shorts Music Library starting at the date and time you specify in your feed.\n\n**Note** : Preview art tracks won\u2019t appear in YouTube Music, on Official Artist Channels, or on Artist profiles. Preview art tracks may be discoverable by users in YouTube search results during the first 48 hours after the full-length track is released.\n\nThe accompanying full length art track won\u2019t be released until the date and time you specify in your feed. The preview art track video and the full length art track video will embed the same sound recording asset.\n\nOnce the full-length track is released, we\u2019ll automatically update any Shorts that use the preview to redirect to the full-length track. We\u2019ll also update the associated Shorts pivot page created using the preview.\n\nTo create a preview and make it available in Shorts, you must:\n\n  1.

You upload content by copying the necessary files into your dropbox, then letting us know that they are ready by creating an empty file named delivery.complete.\n\nWhich files you need to complete an upload depends on which asset type you\u2019re uploading. Every upload job must include a metadata file in XML or CSV format and any new media files that the metadata file references by name.\n\nWe recommend uploading new assets one at a time, each with its own dropbox folder and metadata file. For example, if you\u2019re uploading three episodes of a TV program, create three separate folders and three separate metadata files. This approach makes it easier to track the progress of the upload and limits the impact of any issues that occur, without any impact on the upload processing speed.\n\n(Other recommended best practices)\n\nThese instructions explain how to upload content using Cyberduck, but you can use any client software that supports SFTP connections.\n\nTo upload content to your SFTP dropbox:\n\n  1.

The client connects to your dropbox and displays the top-level folders.  \n\nIf you haven't set up a connection for your dropbox yet, see Connecting to your SFTP dropbox.\n\n  3. Create a new folder for the new upload job.  \n\nTo create a folder, right-click in the file listings pane and select **New Folder**. To avoid possible conflicts, we recommend that you create a new directory each time you post content for YouTube and that you include a timestamp or incremental ID in each directory's name.\n\n  4. Copy all of the files for the upload package into the new folder.  \n\nTo copy files into a folder, right-click the folder in Cyberduck and select **Upload**. Navigate to the folder with your files and select all the files you wish to upload to this folder.  \n\nAlternatively, you can click-and-drag files from your computer into the folder in Cyberduck to upload.\n\n  5. When all files are copied, upload the delivery.complete file to the same folder.\n\nWhen YouTube begins processing the batch, it replaces the files you uploaded with a continuously updated status file named delivery.processing.\n\nYou must not add any new files to the directory or any of its subdirectories after posting the delivery.complete file. Depending on the size of the batch, it can take a few seconds or minutes before you notice the files being processed. **Do not upload more than one delivery.complete file per batch.**\n\nAfter processing each upload batch, the upload engine posts a status report detailing the actions taken for each item in the batch. The report is named status-_xml-filename_ , where _xml-filename_ is the filename of your metadata file. The status report is placed in your dropbox in the same directory as the upload batch.\n\nThe time needed to process an upload batch and generate a status report varies depending on system load and the actions requested. For example, the system requires much less time to process updates to an asset's metadata than to process new reference files. The upload engine will also spend additional processing time on batches that generate failed actions, because the system retries certain failed actions to ensure that failures were not caused by transient conditions such as system downtime. In some cases, we may require more than one day to process an upload batch.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3079146\n\n[CATEGORY] Use an SFTP dropbox\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Upload content to your Aspera dropbox\n\nThese features are only available to partners using YouTube's Content Manager to manage their copyrighted content.\n\nAfter validating the metadata for an upload batch, you're ready to upload the files. You upload content by copying the necessary files into your dropbox, then letting us know that they are ready by creating an empty file named delivery.complete.\n\nWhich files you need to complete an upload depends on which asset type you\u2019re uploading. Every upload job must include a metadata file in XML or CSV format and any new media files that the metadata file references by name.\n\nWe recommend uploading new assets one at a time, each with its own dropbox folder and metadata file. For example, if you\u2019re uploading three episodes of a TV program, create three separate folders and three separate metadata files. This approach makes it easier to track the progress of the upload and limits the impact of any issues that occur, without any impact on the upload processing speed.\n\n(Other recommended best practices)The weekly maintenance window for Aspera dropboxes is Monday from 1am-5am Pacific time. If you upload content during that time, your Aspera client may be disconnected from the dropbox. If that happens, reconnect to the dropbox after five to ten minutes and redeliver the complete file.\n\nTo upload content to your Aspera dropbox:\n\n  1. Open your Aspera client.\n\n  2. Select the connection for your dropbox in the **Connection** box on the right, then click the **Connect** button.\n\nThe Aspera client connects to your dropbox and displays the top-level folders.\n\nIf you haven't set up a connection for your dropbox yet, see Connecting to your Aspera dropbox.\n\n  3. Create a new folder for the new upload job.\n\nTo create a folder, right-click on the parent folder and select **New > Folder**. To avoid possible conflicts, we recommend that you create a new directory each time you post content and that you include a timestamp or incremental ID in each directory's name.\n\n  4. Copy all of the files for the upload package into the new folder.\n\nTo copy files into a folder, make sure the intended folder is open on the right, highlight the files in the box on the left, and click the right-facing arrow.\n\n  5. When all files are copied, upload the delivery.complete file to the same folder.\n\nYou must not add any new files to the directory or any of its subdirectories after posting the delivery.complete file. Depending on the size of the batch, it can take a few seconds or minutes before you notice the files being processed. **Do not upload more than one delivery.complete file per batch.**\n\nAfter processing each upload batch, the upload engine posts a status report detailing the actions taken for each item in the batch.

If the music video asset claims more than one video, YouTube uses the most popular one (the one with the most views).\n\nNote: To edit the official video for a sound recording, you must be the content owner with rights to the ISRC.\n\nTo associate a music video with a sound recording: \n\n  1. From the Assets page, find and open the asset for the sound recording.\n  2. On the asset detail page, click **OFFICIAL VIDEO** in the tab bar.\n  3. The lower portion of the page shows the video currently associated with this recording.\n  4. Click the pencil icon in the upper right to edit the list.\n  5. Find the music video asset you want to use as the official music video for this sound recording, and click the check box in its row.\n  6.

Asset labels are intended for grouping categories of assets and claims, not as a unique field. For example, a unique code such as \u201cRTC1403728\u201d should be a custom ID instead of an asset label.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6393760\n\n[CATEGORY] Use asset labels\n\n\n"

Learn more about license pricing.\n\n**Notes** :\n\n  * One license strategy can apply to many assets.\n  * You can create up to 5000 license strategies.\n  * If a publisher has provided a pricing floor, your license strategy must meet the minimum price set by the publisher.

An Art Track consists of the sound recording and the album art.\n\nThe purpose of Art Tracks is to provide a YouTube version of every track on every album. Currently, official music videos are available for recordings only when a label or artist invests (non-trivial) time and resources into producing one. Art Tracks automate the creation of versions for recordings even if they don\u2019t have a produced music video.  \n\nYouTube creates one Art Track for each track that you upload using the YouTube Music DDEX feed or the \"Audio - Art Tracks\" bulk upload spreadsheet. It identifies tracks based on their ISRC, release identifier (UPC, EAN, GRid), and partner. YouTube will create Art Tracks for each unique combination of these fields.\n\nArt Tracks ensure that YouTube has a complete music catalog and appear in album playlists and in search results.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6007071\n\n[CATEGORY] Manage art tracks\n\n\n"

You may notice that label partners sometimes claim these videos using one or more Sound Recording assets for the official master recording, even though the masters are not being used in the video. This is not the correct approach. \n\n  1. Publishers should first search for existing Sound Recording assets that represent the entire medley contained within the video (i.e. a single asset for the entirety of musical works as performed by the artist in the video). If found, proceed to the next section (\u201cMedley w/Accompanying SR/MV/AT\u201d).\n  2. If no Sound Recordings are found representing the medley, Composition Share assets can be used to directly claim the video, and payout will automatically be prorated according to the number of composition claims made on the video. If the publisher controls multiple compositions in the medley, they should create a claim for each.\n  3. It\u2019s important to request that any owners of Sound Recordings that are not specific to the Web-Claim Medley remove their claims.

If multiple publishers try to embed their individual compositions in the Sound Recording for these videos, they will run into conflict, since the asset claiming the video is in fact representative of multiple musical works. Publishers should work together to represent their ownerships accurately, but are also open to use the following workflow to expedite the process: \n\n  1. The publishing partner locates the Sound Recording asset specific to the medley in question and listens to the medley, identifying the total number of compositions represented. **Note:** The number of times that a composition repeats and the length of the composition used are not referenced if using this approach - just the overall number of distinct compositions.\n  2. The partner then creates a new Composition Share asset, specific to the medley, rather than using their existing Composition Share asset for the composition represented.\n  3. To calculate their ownership percentage, the publisher multiplies their ownership percentage on the individual composition times 1 / the number of compositions in the medley.\n\nExample: \n  * Song \u201cMedley Song\u201d is represented by Sound Recording asset \u201cMedley-SR-Asset.\u201d Medley Song contains 4 distinct compositions - \u201cSong 1,\u201d Song 2,\u201d etc.\n  * Publisher A is able to provide Performance licensing for 40% of Song 1 and 20% of Song 2 globally.\n  * Publisher A locates Medley-SR-Asset and listens to the reference file. They identify that the medley contains 4 compositions (\u201cSong 1,\u201d \u201cSong 2,\u201d etc.). 1 divided by 4 = .25, meaning each composition represents 25% of the medley.\n  * Publisher A then creates a new Composition Share asset representing their unique contributions to the medley - \u201cMedley-Composition-Asset.\u201d It\u2019s critical that this is different from their existing Composition Share assets for Song 1 and Song 2.\n  * Since Publisher A can license 40% of Song 1, and 20% of Song 2, they will have an ownership on the new medley Composition Share asset of: (40% ownership * 25% of the medley) + (20% ownership * 25% of the medley) = 15%\n  * Publisher A embeds Medley-Composition-Asset in Medley-SR-Asset.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7549839\n\n[CATEGORY] Advanced topics for music partners\n\n\n"

The MLC will also collect the royalties due under those licenses from DSPs, including YouTube, and pay copyright owners.\n\nYouTube and the DSP community (represented by the nonprofit Digital Licensee Coordinator or \u201cDLC\u201d) are committed to the success of the Music Modernization Act (MMA)\u2019s implementation and the MLC. From fully funding the MLC\u2019s operations to working collaboratively with the organization on data and reporting, DSPs are playing a critical role in the MMA\u2019s implementation. The MLC and the DLC share a common goal to deliver royalties accurately and on time to copyright owners. \n\nWith this change comes new responsibilities for everyone in the music community to make sure their copyright ownership data is organized and up-to-date. The MLC is building a database of copyright ownership info called The MLC Portal. Copyright owners are encouraged to visit the MLC site to learn how the MLC process works, see answers to frequently asked questions, sign up for updates, and more.\n\nDigital Service Providers (DSPs) are encouraged to visit the Digital Licensee Coordinator site for more info about the DLC.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10192537\n\n[CATEGORY] Advanced topics for music partners\n\n\n"

Note that views from the old Art Track asset are lost and can't be transferred to the new Art track video.\n\nIf the transferred catalog is large, the receiving partner may need to batch deliveries over several days to avoid reaching the limit of allowed deliveries per partner per day.

Some content can be misleading on its own, but it may be less harmful to viewers when there\u2019s context. Context can include criticizing a hateful ideology, or discrediting false claims by highlighting views from authoritative sources, like health or election authorities. These examples illustrate content that\u2019s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception: |   \n---|---  \nContent where an individual makes a false claim that individuals who are older than a certain age aren\u2019t allowed to vote in a democratic election.

        "content": "# How YouTube evaluates Educational, Documentary, Scientific, and Artistic (EDSA) content\n\n## What context to add to your EDSA content\n\n### Examples of discouraging dangerous behavior\n\nDiscouraging imitation helps reduce the risk of harm to viewers and the YouTube community. This**** is especially helpful when content shows activities that are harmful or dangerous or when content is related to self-harm. Remember that this is not a free pass to promote or celebrate dangerous behavior. Simply saying, \u201cDon\u2019t try this at home\u201d may not result in an exception if it\u2019s not accompanied by an explanation of potential harm. These examples illustrate content that\u2019s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception: |   \n---|---  \nContent that shows a home invasion prank, and the content tells the viewer not to imitate the dangerous activity because it could result in physical or emotional harm. |  Content that shows a home invasion prank or a reaction video to a home invasion prank. Laughing or reacting to a dangerous activity may not be enough to reduce the potential harm of a viewer imitating it.  \nContent that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders. The content tells the viewer not to imitate the stunt because of the serious harm it could cause or recommends professional supervision. |  Content that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders without more context.  \n\n**Note** : The above examples aren't a complete list of the context that you can add to your EDSA content. When in doubt, add multiple forms of context to your EDSA content. To help prevent content from causing harm, include the info in your video, not just your video\u2019s title or description.\n\nWhen in doubt, include different types of context described above: basic factual information that explains what\u2019s in your content, multiple points of view, and clear and informative discouragement against imitating dangerous or harmful behavior. Be sure to include this information in the content itself, like the video or audio, to help avoid the content potentially causing harm. \n\nWe may apply an age restriction or warning to content even if it gets an EDSA exception because some viewers may find it sensitive or inappropriate (for example, war zone footage). In some cases, we may make EDSA exceptions based on public interest. This could include, for example, content like national political candidates on the campaign trail, graphic footage from active warzones or humanitarian crises, comments disputing health authority guidance made during a public hearing, or nudity in the context of sex education.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162\n\n[CATEGORY] Best practices for creators\n\n\n"

A trademark is acquired by a company or other entity through a legal process. Once it\u2019s acquired, it gives the owner exclusive rights to the trademark use concerning those goods.\n\nTrademark infringement is improper or unauthorized use of a trademark in a way that is likely to cause confusion as to the source of that product. YouTube policies prohibit videos and channels that infringe trademarks. If your content uses someone else\u2019s trademarks in a way that might cause confusion, your videos can be blocked. Your channel may also be suspended.\n\nIf you think your trademark is being infringed, keep in mind that YouTube doesn\u2019t mediate trademark disputes between creators and trademark owners. As a result, we strongly encourage trademark owners to speak directly with the creator who posted the content in question. Contacting the uploader may fix the problem faster in a way that benefits everyone. Some creators list ways they can be contacted in their channel.\n\nIf you can't reach a resolution with the account holder in question, submit a trademark complaint through our Trademark complaint form. \n\nSubmit a trademark complaint\n\nYouTube is willing to perform a limited review of reasonable complaints and will remove content in clear cases of infringement. To help solve disputes, YouTube forwards each trademark complaint to the uploader before taking any action. This lets the uploader address any potential Trademark issues. \n\nWe'll also accept free-form trademark complaints submitted by email, fax, and mail.\n\nIf your complaint relates to the sale or promotion of counterfeit goods, please file a Counterfeit complaint.\n\nIf your complaint relates to a protected work, such as a song, movie, or book, please file a Copyright complaint.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6154218\n\n[CATEGORY] Legal policies\n\n\n"

For example, apps can select specific products, the destination for cloud exports, and the frequency for scheduled takeouts.  \n\nHere is an example of the format for a url utilizing all three parameters is:\n\nhttps://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/google_account,my_activity,fit,youtube?dest=drive&frequency=2_months  \n\n**Tip:** This example is a work in progress, and may be updated from time to time. The possible values for applications or other products to include can be found in the source of the rendered html within the css attribute(s) titled \u201cdata-id\u201d. For example, possible values for the \u201cdest\u201d parameter include \"box\", \"dropbox\", \"drive\", \"onedrive\". The possible values for the \u201cfrequency\u201d parameter include \u201c2_months\u201d\n\nTo identify the value of the data-id property for products with data capable of being exported for your account: \n\n**Important:** These instructions are for use with Chrome. If you use another browser, the process may vary.\n\n  1. On a computer, visit takeout.google.com.\n  2. Right-click on the Takeout web page and select the \"source page\" view. This will allow you to see the HTML code that makes up the page. \n  3. Use the search command (Control + F on Windows or Command + F on Mac) to identify the \u201cdata-id\u201d property. \n  4. Check the search results. What appears after the \u201cdata-id=\u201d are the relevant values. For example: data-id=\"blogger\"\n\nGoogle has also released a new set of advanced features (Data Portability API) for developers, for the use of data by third-party applications.

The claim will keep you from monetizing the video, even if you only use a few seconds, such as short uses of popular songs.\n\nAutomated systems like Content ID can\u2019t decide fair use because it\u2019s a subjective, case-by-case decision that only courts can make. While we can\u2019t decide on fair use or mediate copyright disputes, fair use can still exist on YouTube. If you believe that your video falls under fair use, you can defend your position through the Content ID dispute process. This decision shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. Sometimes, you may need to carry that dispute through the appeal and DMCA counter notification process.\n\nIf both you and the claimant try to monetize a video under dispute, the video will still monetize until the dispute is resolved. Then, we\u2019ll pay out the accrued earnings to the appropriate party. \n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6396261\n\n[CATEGORY] Learn about copyright on YouTube\n\n\n"

Don\u2019t use copyrighted material unless it\u2019s essential to your video. Check out the YouTube Audio Library for music that\u2019s free of charge to use in your videos. If you choose to get music from other royalty-free or licensing sites, be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully. Some of these services may not give rights to use or monetize the music on YouTube, so you could still end up with a Content ID claim.\n\nIf you get a Content ID claim for music that isn\u2019t essential to your video, try removing it or swapping it out with copyright-safe tracks from the Audio Library. You can also always upload an entirely new edit of the video without the claimed content at a new URL.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6396261\n\n[CATEGORY] Learn about copyright on YouTube\n\n\n"

The systems are continuously trained on data from previous decisions made by human reviewers, and only process removal requests when there\u2019s a high degree of confidence that the request has all the _legally required elements_ and isn\u2019t abusive. Abusive requests are when someone is intentionally and maliciously attempting to remove content from YouTube through a likely false assertion of copyright ownership.\n\nWhen our automated systems are unsure if the removal request is valid (has all the legally required elements and isn\u2019t abusive), then a trained human reviewer evaluates the request. If they need more information to validate the request, then a human reviewer will email the claimant and ask for more information. For example, claimants may be asked to:\n\n  * Provide a more specific title for their copyrighted work\n  * Submit evidence that they\u2019re authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner they\u2019re representing\n  * Confirm that they\u2019ve considered whether the video could be protected by copyright exceptions, such as fair use or fair dealing\n\nIf a claimant doesn\u2019t respond to the email or doesn\u2019t provide the required information, the content in question will remain on YouTube.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13823830\n\n[CATEGORY] Copyright claim basics\n\n\n"

YouTube can't request the removal for you.\n\nMost sites that permit creators to upload videos rely on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\u2019s (DMCA) Safe Harbor. When they get a complete and valid copyright removal request from a copyright owner, they should remove the content. There are some exceptions, but if you're sure the copy of your work doesn't qualify for a copyright exception, like fair use or fair dealing, you can request its removal.\n\nTo understand what you need to include in a copyright removal request, review the requirements of a DMCA takedown notice.\n\nMost sites require a link to a specific video URL. If you don\u2019t find the URL, you can try right-clicking the video or clicking the video's timestamp to get it.\n\nSites that rely on the DMCA must have contact information for a designated DMCA agent listed with the US Copyright Office and on their website. If you find your video on one of these sites without your permission, you can send your copyright removal request to the appropriate email address below. If the site you're looking for isn't listed below, you can also check the US Copyright Office's DMCA agent database.\n\nDailymotion: notifications@dailymotion.com\n\nInstagram: ip@instagram.com\n\nFacebook: ip@fb.com\n\nTikTok: copyright@tiktok.com\n\nTwitter: copyright@twitter.com\n\nVimeo: dmca@vimeo.com\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13823830\n\n[CATEGORY] Copyright claim basics\n\n\n"

        "content": "# Learn about scheduled copyright takedown removal requests\n\nIf a copyright owner finds their copyright-protected content on YouTube without their permission, they can submit a copyright removal request. \n\nAs part of this process, they may select the option to schedule the removal of the copyright-protected content. This means, after YouTube validates the removal request, the uploader is given 7 days to take action before a copyright strike is applied to their channel. During this 7-day period, there are a few different actions uploaders can take:\n\n  * **Delete their video** : If the uploader removes their video from YouTube before 7-day period is over, then their channel won't get a copyright strike. \n    * After the 7-day period is over, removing the video will not resolve the copyright strike. \n  * **Contact the claimant** : Uploaders can get in touch with the person who submitted the removal request (the claimant) and ask them to retract their copyright removal request.\n  * **Cancel an appeal** : If the scheduled removal request was a result of an uploader appealing a Content ID claim, the uploader can cancel their appeal within the 7-day period. \n    * By canceling, the uploader prevents the removal of their content and their channel won\u2019t get a copyright strike. However, the Content ID claim will remain active on their video. Learn more about the difference between copyright removal requests and Content ID claims.\n  * **Do nothing** : Uploaders can wait for the removal request to take effect after the 7-day period is over. At that point, the content will be removed from YouTube and a copyright strike will be applied to the uploader's channel. Then, the uploader can choose if and how they want to resolve the copyright strike. \n    * Content can be affected by more than one Content ID claim or removal request, but can only have one copyright strike at a time.\n\nAt this point, if the uploader believes their video was mistakenly removed, they can submit a counter notification.

To qualify for Content ID, copyright owners must have previously submitted many valid takedown requests and have the resources to manage Content ID, among other criteria.\n\nContent ID is a matching system that automatically identifies content that may be infringing. When videos are uploaded to YouTube, they\u2019re scanned against a database of files submitted by copyright owners. If Content ID finds content that matches one of your works, you can choose actions to take, such as:\n\n  * Block a whole video from being viewed\n  * Monetize the video by running ads against it, sometimes sharing revenue with the uploader\n  * Track the video\u2019s viewership statistics\n\nThese actions can be specific to a country/region. For example, a video may be monetized in one country/region, and blocked or tracked in another.\n\nLearn more about Content ID.\n\n**Notes** : \n\n  * Even unintentional misuse of Content ID can have serious consequences for YouTube and creators.\n  * Content ID comes with complex controls that require ongoing management and an advanced understanding of copyright.\n  * Copyright owners who use Content ID must also make sure their content is eligible for Content ID and safe for automated matching technology.\n  * Many copyright owners prefer to use a third-party service provider to manage their rights using Content ID. These Content ID service providers act on behalf of copyright owners for a fee. You can find one in this directory.\n\n**Keep in mind:**\n\n  * Using any of these copyright management tools to submit a takedown request starts a legal process.\n  * Misuse of any of these tools, such as submitting false information, may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.\n  * Before submitting takedown requests, it\u2019s important to consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or other exceptions to copyright applies in each situation.\n\n[LINK] http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9245819\n\n[CATEGORY] Copyright management tools\n\n\n"

We can only tell who uploaded a video first, not who owns it or has permission to upload it.\n\nMany creators give other channels permission to reupload their videos. Sometimes, creators will reach a licensing agreement after the reupload, or collaborate on videos and upload copies to several channels.\n\nIn addition, not every use of your content may be infringing on your copyright. Fair use and public domain are a few examples of reasons a reupload of your content may be valid.\n\nTo balance the rights of uploaders with the rights of original copyright owners, the Copyright Match Tool tries to give creators info about reuploads.
